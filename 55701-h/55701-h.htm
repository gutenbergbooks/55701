FOREWORD</h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> olden days kings and emperors sent their
armies to conquer weaker nations. As soon as
the victory was won, the flag of the vanquished
was torn down, and the flag of the victor was
raised.</p>

<p>Two thousand years ago a new king sent his
army into the world. It was a small army with
no guns and no battleships, and in it were only
twelve men. They were commanded to go first
to the lands nearest to them and then out "into
all the world."</p>

<p>They were not to tear down any flags, but
they were to raise the banner of their Leader
above all other flags. There was on it a new
device, a Cross, which signified that the king
was a King of Love. His commands were such
as no other conqueror had ever given:</p>

<p class="blockquot">
<span class="smcap">Teach All Nations</span><br />
<span class="smcap">Heal the Sick</span><br />
<span class="smcap">Cleanse the Leper</span><br />
<span class="smcap">Feed the Hungry</span><br />
<span class="smcap">Clothe the Naked</span><br />
<span class="smcap">Preach the Gospel</span><br />
</p>

<p>The enemies against whom His soldiers were
to fight were not human beings, however wicked
and depraved they might be, but ignorance and
poverty and superstition and hunger, which
made people wicked.</p>

<p>The army did not long number only twelve
men; it soon grew to hundreds and thousands.
Of the soldiers some were shipwrecked, some
were stoned, some faced lions and tigers and
poisonous serpents; but they all did the King's
work. They preached the gospel, not only from
pulpits, but in schools and hospitals and on the
farm. They taught men how to make better
homes, and to raise more food; they healed
the sick and comforted the dying by telling them
of Heaven. Under many flags they fought, but
by their lives and their teachings they lifted
the flag of their Leader above all.</p>

<p>It is of a few of these brave men and women
that this book tells. The authors hope that the
boys and girls who read it will enlist in this
army.</p>

<small>A BAKER BY NECESSITY</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was muster day in Maine, and little Cyrus
Hamlin was about to start from the farm on
which he lived with his mother and brother to
town where he would see the regiment hold a
sham battle. He had expected his brother to
go with him, but he was ill. As Cyrus started
away alone, his mother said:</p>

<p>"Here are seven cents to buy gingerbread
with. Perhaps you will put a cent in the missionary
box as you go by Mrs. Farrar's house."</p>

<p>Cyrus thought he had a great deal of money.
Seven cents in those days were as much as fifty
now, and they would buy a good deal for a small
boy. He could easily spare a little for the
missionary box.</p>

<p>As he went along he tried to decide whether
he should put one cent or two into the box, and
he wished his mother had said definitely either
one cent or two and had not given him a choice.
Finally he decided on two. Then a voice within
him said,</p>

<p>"Well, Cyrus! Five cents for yourself and
only two for the heathen!"</p>

<p>He decided that he would put in three cents.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
By this time he came to Mrs. Farrar's house
and there was the box. Was it right to keep
three cents for himself and give only four to
the heathen? He stood staring and thinking,
thinking, thinking. At last he grew tired trying
to decide, and what do you suppose he did? Into
the missionary box went every penny!</p>

<p>All day long he trotted round watching the
soldiers, listening to the bands, and having a
good time. But he didn't go near any refreshment
tables. Late in the afternoon he made for
home and burst into the house crying out:</p>

<p>"Mother! I'm as hungry as a bear! I
haven't had a mouthful today."</p>

<p>His mother was astonished.</p>

<p>"Did you lose the money I gave you?"</p>

<p>"No," said Cyrus. "But you didn't give it
to me right. It wouldn't divide equally, so I
dropped it all in."</p>

<p>"You poor boy!" said Mrs. Hamlin, half
laughing, half crying. "Just a minute and you
shall have your supper!"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Several years later Cyrus thought earnestly
about another problem. He and his brother had
all they could do to keep the farm going. There
was no money to buy new farm implements, no
money even to keep them in order. Gradually
they wore out, and after a while the yoke for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
the oxen went to pieces. The making of an
ox-yoke is a very difficult matter for a grown
man and almost impossible for two boys thirteen
and fifteen years old. But Cyrus and his
brother examined the old yoke and looked at
each other and then back at the yoke.</p>

<p>"We can't buy one," said the brother.</p>

<p>"We'll make one!" said Cyrus.</p>

<p>They cut down a birch tree and set to work.
They did not have the proper tools, but they
borrowed them&mdash;and you may be sure they returned
them in good shape,&mdash;and they put in
all their spare time for days. By and by the
yoke was hewn out, and they scraped it with
glass and polished it with a dry stick. But alas,
when they bored the holes for the bows to fit
into, they put them in the wrong place!</p>

<p>Did this discourage them? Only for a minute.
They knit their brows, they looked at each
other and then at the ruined yoke, and they
went and cut down another tree. This time they
succeeded in making a perfect yoke, and when
it was painted a bright red, they were the happiest
boys in Maine.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Still another time Cyrus set his mind on an
interesting problem. He was now almost a
man; he had determined to be a missionary, and
he was studying in the Academy six miles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
from home. Every other Saturday he walked
home around Bear Pond and across Hawk
Mountain. He carried his gun with him, and as
he went along, he sometimes shot game to take
to his mother. Once he met a bear, but the bear
got away.</p>

<p>The view from the top of the mountain was
wonderful, and Cyrus had an eye for beauty.
One day as he turned from a look at the distant
woods and fields, his eye fell upon an object near
at hand. At his feet the precipice dropped suddenly
a hundred feet and on the very edge hung
a large boulder.</p>

<p>He looked at this boulder with interest. One
Fourth of July the young men in the neighborhood
had gathered to see whether they could
push it over, but had failed. Cyrus suddenly
forgot everything but this rock. Could anything
in the world be more delightful than to
shove the great thing off and hear it go crashing
down? It couldn't do any harm, and it
would be better than any Fourth of July celebration
ever staged.</p>

<p>He not only stared at the rock, he examined
it carefully, and then he thought again. The
boulder rested on gravel, and if that could be
cut out, down it would fly. He hurried home
to tell his brother.</p>

<p>The next Saturday the two Hamlins and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
friend met on the mountain and dug away at
the sandy bed on which the rock lay, but it did
not move. The next Saturday they came again.
At supper time it seemed as though they would
have to give up all hope of finishing that day,
and they were dreadfully afraid that some one
would come and complete the work and get the
credit.</p>

<p>"Let supper wait!" said they.</p>

<p>Again they set to work, and presently one of
them shouted, "It's moving!"</p>

<p>With a wild leap the boys got out of the way.
The rock moved slowly at first, then faster and
faster and in the end it plunged down, striking
sheets of fire as it flew. Bang! it struck the
granite cliff and burst into three great fragments.
Swish! it rushed down on its way to an
open field below.</p>

<p>Never were there three happier boys. They
went home to supper in the twilight, hearing
the echo of the terrific crash and knowing that
the great boulder had had to yield to their
strength and persistence.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But the time came when Cyrus Hamlin faced
problems a thousand times more serious than
making an ox-yoke or moving a boulder. He
became a missionary as he had intended and
was sent to Constantinople. There he taught<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
Armenian boys in Bebek Seminary, and it became
the dream of his life to build a college.</p>

<p>"Education is the way to peace and enlightenment,"
he would say. "If we could found
Christian institutions where we could train
young men in all professions, then they could
go out to set an example to their fellow countrymen
and be their leaders."</p>

<p>He never walked through the narrow streets
or crossed the Golden Horn without looking all
round for a suitable location, and he had already
about twenty in mind. But his dream did
not come true. In the first place, there was no
money. In the second place, he had to fill with
other work all the time he might have spent
planning for a college. He had to be textbook
as well as teacher, and he had to make all his
own apparatus.</p>

<p>When he moved into a house, he had to repair
it; when his poor Armenian students and their
families were without clothes, he had to find a
way to cover them. When they were refused
work by the cruel Turks, he had to find work
for them. He taught them how to make and sell
stoves and stove-pipes and various useful
articles.</p>

<p>One poor man became insane when he had
no way of supporting himself and his family
and believed that he was turned to stone. Just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
as soon as Dr. Hamlin gave him work, he was
cured. Dr. Hamlin suggested to him that it was
best to make an article for which there was a
demand.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Robert College, Constantinople</span></p>

<p class="caption">This picture taken in Turkey in Asia looks across the Bosphorus, a mile wide at this point,
to Turkey in Europe and the site chosen by Cyrus Hamlin for his college. The modern
buildings "rub elbows" with towers six hundred years old.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>"If there are thirteen hundred thousand inhabitants
in Constantinople, there are thirteen
hundred million rats," said he. "Make rat
traps! I'll show you how!"</p>

<p>Soon the man had to have assistants to sell
his traps.</p>

<p>Still more Armenians came for help, and Dr.
Hamlin had to stop dreaming about his college
and plan how he could feed them. An idea had
occurred to him vaguely; now it grew into a
well-developed scheme. He would teach them
to make bread. Everybody needed bread, and
in Constantinople the bread was not good and
all the work was done by horse-power. He
would bake by steam.</p>

<p>The fact that he had never made bread did
not trouble him in the least. He had never made
an ox-yoke, or rolled a boulder down a mountain
until he tried.</p>

<p>His fellow-missionaries laughed at him, but
they couldn't laugh him out of his plans, and
he ordered his machinery from America. The
difficulties were many, some were serious and
some funny; but in the end the engine and the
boiler were set up and everything was in order.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
The dough was mixed, the oven heated, the
loaves were moulded; but alas, the bread was
sour and could not be eaten. Dr. Hamlin experimented
again and again until one morning
he had delicious loaves of bread to sell.</p>

<p>Now he smoothed out his forehead. The
bakery was successful, the poor Armenian
Christians had work; again he could devote his
time to his teaching and could think of his
college.</p>

<p>But he was mistaken. England and Russia
went to war, and to Scutari on the other side of
the Bosphorus were brought the wounded English
soldiers. Dr. Hamlin looked across the
water and thought of the suffering boys and
hated war. He did not think of any effect upon
himself. But he was to be seriously affected.</p>

<p>One day an orderly came to the door of the
Seminary and asked him to come to the hospital
at the invitation of the chief physician, Dr.
Mapleton.</p>

<p>"And what does he want with me?" asked
Dr. Hamlin. "I'm very busy."</p>

<p>"He wants to see you about bread."</p>

<p>"About bread!" repeated Dr. Hamlin, and
obeyed, wondering.</p>

<p>In the hospital he found himself in the presence
of a busy man, so burdened by responsibilities
that he hardly had time to look up.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>"Are you Hamlin the baker?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I'm Hamlin the missionary."</p>

<p>Dr. Mapleton lifted his head. "That's just
like everything in this country," he said irritably.
"I send for a baker and get a missionary!
Thank God, I'm not a heathen that I
should want a missionary!"</p>

<p>Dr. Hamlin laughed. "But I'm the baker,"
he said.</p>

<p>"You, the baker!" repeated Dr. Mapleton.</p>

<p>Dr. Hamlin explained how he had been forced
into the baking business.</p>

<p>"Then will you bake bread for our hospital?
What we get is not fit to eat. Our poor invalids
won't touch it; they can't. We're in a tight
place."</p>

<p>Dr. Hamlin stood with knitted brows.</p>

<p>"You will, won't you?" said the physician,
earnestly.</p>

<p>Dr. Hamlin uttered a fateful "yes." One
couldn't refuse such a plea as this! In a few
minutes the contract was signed. He promised
to furnish two hundred and fifty loaves a day.
But as he left the hospital he looked around.
Two hundred and fifty loaves a day! They
would not go far if all these beds were to be
filled by patients. It looked as though the whole
British army were expected.</p>

<p>Alas, the beds were all needed. First fifty a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
day, then a hundred a day, the soldiers were
carried in from the hospital ships, sick, dying,
with dreadful wounds. Dr. Hamlin could
neither teach his Armenians nor dream about
his college when he had six thousand, then
twelve thousand loaves of bread to make each
day. He thought of nothing but baking.</p>

<p>The poor patients had almost no nursing, and
his heart ached. He offered to organize a corps
of nurses for the night when there was no one
to take care of the helpless invalids, but he was
refused by the brutal officers.</p>

<p>Then one morning he went to the hospital and
heard a strange piece of news. A soldier told
him, his eyes almost popping from his head in
his astonishment:</p>

<p>"Fancy, Mr. Hamlin! Some <i>women</i> have
come to this hospital. Did you ever hear of such
a dreadful and improper thing?"</p>

<p>"What women?" asked Dr. Hamlin.</p>

<p>"A Miss Florence Nightingale with a force
of assistants."</p>

<p>"Good for her!" said Dr. Hamlin. "It's
time that somebody should come here and do
something."</p>

<p>That morning he kept his eyes wider open
than ever. The Hamlin family were famous
hero-worshipers; Cyrus's grandfather had
named six of his boys for heroes. They were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
Africanus, for Scipio Africanus, Hannibal, Cyrus,
Eleazer, Isaac, and Jacob, and the other
three, one might mention incidentally, were
Americus, Asiaticus, and Europus. Here, Dr.
Hamlin saw, was a real live hero, in the bud at
least.</p>

<p>He watched Florence Nightingale moving
quietly about in the scene of misery and horror.
The poor lads spent no more lonely nights.
Every want was attended to. The death-rate
went steadily down. It was one of the great
achievements of history, and he had a part in
it; he baked the only bread Florence Nightingale
would let her sick boys have.</p>

<p>But still his dream had not come true, and in
the confusion it seemed to grow more and more
dim. The war went on, bread had to be baked
every day, new ovens had to be built, thousands
of pounds of flour had to be bargained for.</p>

<p>Presently he had a new occupation&mdash;he set
up a laundry. The clothes of the wounded
men were filthy, and he offered to have them
washed. But they were so filthy that the women
feared to handle them, badly as they needed
work. The brain which had studied the making
of an ox-yoke and the pushing off of a boulder
and the making of bread worked quickly. Out
of an empty cask Dr. Hamlin made a washing
machine, and the vermin-filled clothes did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
have to be touched by hand until they were
clean&mdash;a new problem was solved! His friends
had told him that he had sixteen professions,
and now he had another,&mdash;that of laundryman!</p>

<p>He did not suspect that all the time he was
baking bread and washing clothes there was
coming nearer and nearer the fulfilment of his
dream. He had prayed and hoped that some
day a rich man would come and see the good
that might be done by a Christian college. Now
that good man was at hand, Christopher Robert,
an American merchant.</p>

<p>Mr. Robert was traveling in the East, and one
day as he was crossing the Bosphorus he saw a
boat loaded with loaves of bread.</p>

<p>"What in the world does this mean?" he
asked his friends. "That looks like American
bread. Who bakes it?"</p>

<p>"A missionary named Hamlin," was the answer.</p>

<p>"A missionary who bakes bread!" repeated
Mr. Robert.</p>

<p>"He baked it first to give work to his Armenian
Christians, and when the hospital was
opened he was persuaded to bake it for the patients.
It's the best and also the cheapest
bread ever seen in this part of the world."</p>

<p>"I should like to meet that man," said Mr.
Robert.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>"That will be an easy matter," said his
friends.</p>

<p>But when Mr. Robert met Dr. Hamlin, he
heard only a little about bread and a great deal
about another matter. Though no record of
their conversation has been kept, it must have
been something like this:</p>

<p>"I'm very much interested in your bread-making,
Dr. Hamlin."</p>

<p>"I had no idea what I was getting into," was
Dr. Hamlin's probable reply. "But it had to
be done. What I'm chiefly interested in is the
founding of a Christian college here in Constantinople."</p>

<p>"It must have been a tremendous work to
bake all this bread."</p>

<p>"It was, but oh, Mr. Robert, what wonderful
work we could do if we could have a college to
train young men!"</p>

<p>"And your laundry enterprise, Dr. Hamlin,
that must have been the greatest blessing to the
sick."</p>

<p>"It made them more comfortable. If we
could have a Christian college here, it would
leaven the whole empire."</p>

<p>"How did you learn so many trades, Dr.
Hamlin?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I picked them up. You see, Mr. Robert,"
Dr. Hamlin repeated his favorite sentiment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
"education is the way to peace and enlightenment.
If we could found a large Christian
institution where we could train young men
in all professions, then they could go out to be
the leaders of their people."</p>

<p>It is likely that at this point Mr. Robert gave
up trying to get information about bread-making
and laundering and said, with a
twinkle in his eye, "Well, tell me about your
college!"</p>

<p>Dr. Hamlin took a long breath and began.
How long he had waited! But here, please God,
was a hearer with a receptive heart and a large
purse.</p>

<p>Mr. Robert listened earnestly and his heart
was moved. What better use could one have
for one's money than to bring enlightenment
to this dark corner of the world? In a few minutes
he was not only listening, but helping Dr.
Hamlin to plan, and within a few years Robert
College crowned the hill which Dr. Hamlin selected
as the best site he had considered.</p>

<p>Mr. Robert was a generous man and he
would undoubtedly have put his money to
good use somewhere, but Robert College would
not be shining like a star in a dark sky if he had
not seen Dr. Hamlin's boat-load of bread crossing
the Bosphorus on its way to Florence Nightingale's
sick boys.</p>

<small>THE MAN WITH A MILLION BIBLES</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was a hot summer day. The people of the
city of Paracatu in Brazil were standing or
lounging in groups about the doors of their little
houses, which were built close together.</p>

<p>Children with scant clothing played about in
the streets. Their bare, brown feet were used
to the hot pavements. Mothers sat squatted
in the doorways making lace. One woman was
beating <i>mandioca</i> for her family's <i>almoco</i>, or
lunch, while another woman fanned a fire of
coals on a little round, iron stove.</p>

<p>Suddenly the children ran back out of the
street. The women looked up and saw a procession
of nine mules coming into the city.
Many trains of mules passed by their doors, but
this one was different from the others. The
man who rode on the foremost mule had a very
fair skin. Riding behind him were three Brazilian
men whose faces were dark like the faces
of the women who sat in the doorways and the
children who played in the streets. Five of
the mules carried packs loaded with a tent, some
cooking pots and pans, and books. There were
books not only in the packs on the backs of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
mules, but more books in the pockets of the
four men.</p>

<p>As the procession passed out of sight, the
women looked curiously to see where the men
were going to stop, and wondered why they had
come and what books they carried.</p>

<p>Towards evening one of the women went
about among her neighbors to tell the news she
had heard.</p>

<p>"The man who rode at the head of the mule
train is Dr. Hugh Tucker. He comes from
North America. Tonight he is going to speak
in the public square. There are many people
who say that it is the book which he has that
has made his country great and free."</p>

<p>In the evening a crowd came to the public
square to hear Dr. Tucker. They asked him
many questions. Some who had money, or who
could read, bought Bibles so they could learn
more for themselves of the things he told them.
He gave Bibles to those who had no money.</p>

<p>Dr. Tucker's business was to give the Bible
to the people of Brazil. For years that was
what he had been doing. In the beautiful city
of Rio de Janeiro he had a great store to which
people came by the hundreds to buy Bibles and
from which Bibles were sent by mail and by
colporteurs in all directions.</p>

<p>These colporteurs, or Bible men, went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
through the cities of Brazil and far into the
country. Sometimes they walked, sometimes
they rode on mules, and sometimes they traveled
in ox-carts. Dr. Tucker himself often rode
with them, as he did on this trip when they
stopped at Paracatu. This journey through
towns and open country lasted for six weeks.</p>

<p>There were few houses along the rough and
hilly roads. Now and then long-legged ostriches
ran across the path before the mules.
Gaily colored parrots perched on branches of
the trees; monkeys chattered in the vines beside
the small streams; and here and there a
fox or a tatou ran past. Sometimes the prairie
with its waving grass stretched before them
like an ocean. At night they pitched their tent
beside small streams where the grass grew
fresh and green.</p>

<p>One Sunday morning as they rested in front
of their tent, an ox-cart stopped before them,
and a man jumped out and asked for a cup of
coffee. As he drank the coffee, Dr. Tucker
read to him from the Bible.</p>

<p>"Go on, go on," the man called to his driver.
"I'll follow later. Never in all my life have
I heard such strange things as this book tells."</p>

<p>The next morning the colporteurs were up
at three o'clock. The moon lighted their way
as they rode. They stopped at a house for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
breakfast, and Dr. Tucker took out a Bible and
read from it to their host.</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/p019.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Hugh C. Tucker</span></p>

<p class="caption">Not only did he put the Bible into the pulpits and bookcases of
Brazil, but its spirit of love and service found expression in the
hearts of the people, in parks, schools, and playgrounds.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>"No, no, don't stop!" said the man, when
Dr. Tucker started to help load the mules.
"Read more. Let the others load the animals
while I call my neighbors, that you may read
to them, too, and tell them what these things
mean, for they are new and strange to us."</p>

<p>Every day they met people who asked,
"Where are you going, and what is this new
book you carry with you?"</p>

<p>"How can these things be?" said one man.
"Is it true that so long as two thousand years
ago such wonderful things happened and today
I hear of them for the first time and even yet
my friends have not heard? You are slow about
giving the Bible to my people!"</p>

<p>Now Dr. Tucker had thought he was giving
the Bible to the people of Brazil just as fast as
he could, but he redoubled his efforts. He sent
out still more colporteurs. They gathered the
people in the public squares of the cities and
read and preached to them, and the people
listened gladly. Sometimes the colporteurs
started out with sacks filled with Bibles and
came back with their sacks full of the images
the people had been worshiping and had cast
away when they read, "I am the Lord thy God.
Thou shalt have no other gods before me."</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>Dr. Tucker has given more than a million
Bibles to Brazil. He presented a Bible to President
Prudenti Moraes on his inauguration day.
He has found many ways of giving the spirit of
the Bible in addition to putting the book into
the hands of the people. He does not wish anyone
to think that this is a magical book, and that
it is enough merely to have it.</p>

<p>When he took Bibles to the sick boatmen
down in their poor little mud huts by the river-side,
he found they had no one to care for them
properly,&mdash;there are many thousands of sailors
coming into the port of Rio every year,&mdash;so Dr.
Tucker became the "seamen's friend." He
rented a house and made it a Seamen's Home.
In one year more than ten thousand sailors
came to his Home. Most of them were glad to
pay for their meals and beds, but he did not
turn any away if they were ill or had no money.
There were free beds and free meals for those
who needed help, and doctors to care for those
who were sick, and employment found for those
who were out of work.</p>

<p>While he was preaching in the slums of Rio
he found many people who were poor and sick,
as there are in all great cities. He went to a
young Brazilian doctor and asked him to visit
the homes of the poor people in the slums.</p>

<p>The young doctor came back and said, "Why,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
Dr. Tucker, it is almost enough to make anyone
ill just to go into these homes and see how the
people live. There are so many dark rooms
and so little sunlight, and the houses are very
dirty. In almost every home someone is sick."
Dr. Tucker remembered how the multitudes
came to Jesus and were healed, and so he
thought one of the best ways to give more of
the Bible to the people was to help those who
were sick.</p>

<p>He had stereopticon pictures made which
showed how tuberculosis might be prevented.
Then he went to the United States Ambassador
and to the mayor of Rio and to the president
of the Board of Health and to other great men
who could help him and told them he was going
to give a lecture and wanted them to come and
sit on the platform. He sent cards out all over
the city telling how many people had tuberculosis
and what they should do to be cured and
inviting people to his meeting.</p>

<p>Those who came were so much interested in
the pictures, that the city officials arranged for
him to show them to the children in the public
schools. Then they had him talk to the people
who gathered in the public squares of the city.
The government gave him money to fight tuberculosis,
and he started a hospital where sick
people without money could be treated and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
where they could hear and read about Jesus the
Great Physician.</p>

<p>Next he started a school for poor children.
The children wanted to come to school, and Dr.
Tucker was very happy until he saw how
strangely they behaved.</p>

<p>"What can be the matter with them?" he
asked. "They sit with their hands folded.
They don't want to study or even to play. Their
eyes are dull."</p>

<p>He asked the children questions and visited
their homes to find out why they did not want
to study or to jump about and play.</p>

<p>"No wonder my school children sit with their
hands folded," he said when he came back.
"They are half starved. Some of them have
nothing but a cup of coffee and a pickle to eat
all day."</p>

<p>He remembered how Jesus had fed those who
were hungry, so every day he provided a lunch
of whole wheat mush with milk and sugar.
Soon the hollow cheeks of the children began
to get round and rosy, their eyes began to shine,
and they wanted to run and jump and play.</p>

<p>"I wish we could feed all the hungry children
in Rio," said Dr. Tucker one day. He knew he
could never get them all in his little school, but
he thought of another plan&mdash;he started a cooking
school to teach the mothers to cook good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
meals at home. He told the gas company about
his plan, and they gave him the stoves he
needed. The mothers came with their children,
and while the children learned reading and writing
and arithmetic, the mothers learned how to
prepare food that was better for children than
coffee and pickles. Dr. Tucker had found another
way to give the Bible to Brazil.</p>

<p>One day he said, "The Bible tells us to clothe
the naked, but how can we ever get clothes
enough for all of the poor people of Brazil!"</p>

<p>Presently he walked into the office of a sewing
machine company and told the manager about
his plan to clothe the naked.</p>

<p>"That would be fine!" the manager said.
"Of course the only way to clothe all the poor
people is to teach them how to make their own
clothes."</p>

<p>He sent sewing machines to Dr. Tucker's
school, and soon the mothers were learning to
sew. Dr. Tucker had found still another way
to give the Bible to Brazil.</p>

<p>Now his school children were well and happy.
Their cheeks were round and rosy, for they had
a lunch at school and their mothers gave them
good food at home. Their clothes were neat
and clean, their eyes were bright and shining,
and they were ready to study and play. But
where should they play? There was no trouble<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
about a place to study. They could study
at school or at home, but when they wanted to
play there was no place at all. Rio is one of
the most beautiful cities in the world, and many
of the people are very wealthy and live in beautiful
homes, but Dr. Tucker's poor little children
in the slums lived in houses that were built
close together right on the street.</p>

<p>There was a very beautiful park, with lovely
green grass, but the superintendent of parks
was very proud of his green grass and had a
fence of iron rails around it with a sign, "Keep
off the grass" wherever a child could get in.</p>

<p>Every time Dr. Tucker saw that park, his
eyes looked like the eyes of his school children
when they were hungry. But one day as he
went through the park, his eyes began to twinkle.
He clapped his hands and said to himself,
"I'll do it!" At once he walked up boldly to
the mayor of Rio and the superintendent of
parks.</p>

<p>"The children have no place to play," he
said. "Why don't you open up a part of the
city park for a public playground?"</p>

<p>The mayor and the superintendent of parks
were so shocked they could scarcely say a word.
They were so proud of their beautiful park,
they had never let people even walk on the
grass; and now this bold man actually dared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
to propose that they should put swings and
teeter boards and tennis courts right where the
grass was most beautiful!</p>

<p>But they could not forget what he said about
happy children being worth more than beautiful
grass, and one day they drove to Dr. Tucker's
door in a fine automobile and invited him
to ride with them. They did not ask him where
he wanted to go, but drove straight to the park.</p>

<p>"We have decided to do what you ask and
let you make your playground on one condition,"
announced the mayor.</p>

<p>"Good!" said Dr. Tucker, "What's the condition?"</p>

<p>"That you get all the equipment for a first-class
playground," answered the superintendent
of parks.</p>

<p>Dr. Tucker was thinking very fast. "Equipment
for a first-class playground" meant
swings and bars and teeter boards and tennis
nets and footballs and ever so many other
things boys and girls love in a playground. With
the same twinkle that was in his eyes when he
looked at the park and said, "I'll do it," he said
now, "All right, I'll take you up."</p>

<p>He did not have a single cent in his pocket to
buy all these things and he did not know where
he was going to get so much money, but he said
to himself:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>"I'll look around a bit and see what I can
see."</p>

<p>The first thing he saw was some men tearing
up an old street-car track. He went to the manager
of the street-car company. "What are you
going to do with those old rails?" he asked.
"May I have them?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I guess so," answered the manager.</p>

<p>Dr. Tucker said "Thank you" very politely
and then added, "I'll have to have them shaped
a little differently and a few holes bored in
them. Would you mind doing this in your
shop?"</p>

<p>The manager said he would do that, too.
When Dr. Tucker said "Thank you" very politely
again and turned to go, the manager
asked: "What in the world do you want those
old rails for?"</p>

<p>"For swing supports and all sorts of equipment
for the playground."</p>

<p>He told the manager about his ride with the
mayor and the superintendent of parks and all
about the things he was going to make for the
playground and athletic fields out of those
lovely old rails.</p>

<p>"Nonsense, man!" said the manager. "Those
old rails aren't good enough. Why you ought
to have the best stuff money can buy for Brazil's
first public playground."</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>"Of course we ought," said Dr. Tucker, "but
since we don't have the money to buy them with,
I propose to see what we can make."</p>

<p>"What would you buy if you did have the
money?" asked the manager. "Think it over
and let me know."</p>

<p>Dr. Tucker went home and got a catalog of
a New York store. A few days later he went
into the manager's office with the catalog in
his hand. The manager was so busy he scarcely
had time to look up.</p>

<p>"Are you too busy to look at the things we
need for the playground?" asked Dr. Tucker.</p>

<p>"Yes, I am," replied the manager. "You
just take that catalog and mark what you need,
and when I go to New York perhaps I can get
it for you."</p>

<p>Dr. Tucker's eyes twinkled twice that time.
He felt as if his fairy godmother had shown
him a wonderful palace and told him to help
himself. He sat down and marked in that catalog
the things he knew the boys and girls of
Rio would have marked if they had held his
pencil.</p>

<p>The manager took the catalog to New York
with him and bought every single article that
had a mark before it. He paid for them with
dollars&mdash;seven hundred and forty of them&mdash;out
of his own pocket.</p>

Brazil was open.</p>

he thought of his school and his playground
which put the love of God into visible form.</p>

<p>"The Bible is coming into Brazil," he said
to himself. "Not only into the pulpits and into
bookcases, but its spirit of love and service is
coming into the parks and schools and the
streets and, best of all, into the hearts of the
people." And his own heart was glad.</p>

<small>THE STORY OF POIT</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the interior of South America, with the
rivers Parana and Paraguay to the east, with
Argentine to the south, and Bolivia to the west,
there is a vast, low country called the Gran
Chaco, about as large as the state of Texas and
inhabited by Indians. The country is flat and
there are grass-lands, swamps, and forests of
palm trees. There are many different animals
with which the children of the North are not
familiar but of which they may have seen pictures,
among them the tapir, the marsh deer, the
otter, the peccary, and the armadillo. There
are some savage animals such as the jaguar, the
puma, and a very large wolf with a long mane.</p>

<p>There are also some of the queerest animals
in the world, especially the ant-eater, a bow-legged
creature seven feet long from the tip of
his snout to the tip of his hairy tail. There is
a queer little opossum about the size of a mouse,
with enormous black eyes, fan-like ears, and a
long tail, which runs about in the trees like a
squirrel. Most interesting of all is the lungfish
which can live either in the water or in the air.
In the wet season he stays in the swamps and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
eats and eats, and when the dry season comes
and the swamps disappear, he burrows in the
ground and lives without eating anything, by
using up the fat he has stored.</p>

<p>There are many birds both large and small,
from great ostriches down to tiny hummingbirds,
and there are insects of all kinds, ants and
crickets and mosquitoes and beetles and locusts,
and there are twenty-four different kinds of
frogs, each with a different croak.</p>

<p>For many weeks no rain falls, and the Indians
have a hard time to get along; then when
the rain comes they have more than they need
to eat, water-birds, fish, and, by-and-by, their
harvests. They do not mind having to tramp
round in deep water, because wet weather
brings plenty.</p>

<p>Among the Indians in this strange country
was a young man named Poit. One morning
in December Poit awoke with a frightened, anxious
heart. It was not because he was too warm,
though in December in Chaco the mornings
are hot, nor because he had not slept comfortably
on his bed on the ground nor because he
was hungry; it was because he plotted a wicked
deed. Today Poit planned to do the most dreadful
thing anyone can do, he was going to kill his
best friend, the missionary.</p>

<p>Though these Indians lived so uncomfortably,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
they did not want to change their ways, and
they killed everybody who came to explore their
country or to search for silver or to tell them
of the love of God. Even soldiers sent to conquer
them by force failed because they were
so fierce and cunning.</p>

<p>The chief reason for their resistance and
their cruelty was not wickedness, but ignorance
and dreadful fear. They were afraid of spirits
and afraid of witches and wizards. They were
so afraid that the souls of the dead might come
and annoy them that whenever anyone died they
destroyed the village and went to another place
to live. This wasn't very difficult because their
houses were made of boughs stuck into the
ground. They were especially afraid of people
unlike themselves, and this was the reason they
killed foreigners.</p>

<p>In spite of their objections, a little mission
had been established among them. It was situated
on the banks of the Paraguay River and its
influence did not extend very far inland, but it
was a beginning. The first missionary died as a
result of his hard work, and there arrived one
day a new missionary, a tall, slender young
man, hardly more than a boy in years, whose
name was Barbrooke Grubb.</p>

<p>Mr. Grubb was not satisfied to stay along the
river where he could see only a few of the Indians,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
he determined to travel to the interior
villages. He knew perfectly well that the undertaking
was dangerous. He had heard of the
explorers and the missionaries whom the Indians
had murdered; he knew that a poor white
man who had strayed from his companions and
had taken refuge with them had been slain; he
knew that if sickness broke out while he was
staying in a village, he would be held responsible
and be killed. He knew that if an Indian
had a bad dream about him, he might kill him.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, he not only visited the interior
of the country, but he lived with the Indians for
months at a time, staying in their villages, eating
their strange food, hunting and fishing with
them, so that he might learn all about their ways
and help them. He went unarmed and unprotected,
saying that he was a messenger of peace.</p>

<p>He had many thrilling experiences, and some
that were very funny. Of course he did not
know the language well at first and he mistook
the word "evil" for the word "good," and assured
the people that he was a friend of the
"evil spirit."</p>

<p class="caption">They are not having a picnic, but have just eaten their noonday meal, and the kettle of maize

<p>He had many amusing encounters with the
witch-doctors. You would not think from the
picture of a Chaco witch-doctor that they could
frighten anybody, but these natives lived in
deadly fear of them. Mr. Grubb proved how
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>foolish it was to have faith in them. When a
witch-doctor claimed to have a charm against
bullets, Mr. Grubb said:</p>

<p>"All right; you stand over there and I'll
shoot at you, and you won't mind a bit."</p>

<p>The witch-doctor wouldn't hear of this trial,
and the Indians laughed at him.</p>

<p>Once Mr. Grubb heard that a witch-doctor
was taking needles out of his patients' bodies,
and he proved that the witch-doctor bought all
the needles from him and that the cure was a
pretense.</p>

<p>Some of the Indians were very smart. There
was one called Pinse-apawa, who came into Mr.
Grubb's tent one day just as Mr. Grubb was
taking some medicine. This medicine had an
alcoholic smell though it had a dreadfully bitter
taste, so bitter that you could hardly swallow
it. Pinse-apawa smelled the odor of liquor.</p>

<p>"Ah!" he said. "You won't let us drink
liquor, but when you are here alone you take
it yourself!"</p>

<p>"Have some," invited Mr. Grubb.</p>

<p>Poor Pinse-apawa took a big swallow and
after that he knew the difference between liquor
and medicine.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Now Poit, who opened his eyes on a warm
December morning intending to murder Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
Grubb was not a witch-doctor; he was a clever,
intelligent Indian, and when he was good, he
was a great help. We do not like to call him
a bad Indian, even though he was to do such a
dreadful deed. Though he had had every chance
under Mr. Grubb's teaching to learn to be good,
he had not met him until he was a grown man,
and then it is very hard to change your heart.</p>

<p>By this time Mr. Grubb had been in the Chaco
for seven years, and the work he had done was
truly wonderful. At the mission station there
was a settlement where the people lived in permanent
houses instead of wandering from place
to place. Strangers could go about unarmed
and in safety. The Indians had been taught to
work, not only at odd moments, but steadily.
They had been taught to take care of sheep and
cattle and to raise vegetables.</p>

<p>They had learned to distrust the witch-doctors
and to take precautions against contagion.
They had learned to respect the law and to live
at peace with their neighbors. They had built
several hundred miles of cart tracks. They had
axes, knives, hoes, scissors, and many other possessions
which Mr. Grubb had had shipped from
England to help them to live more comfortably
and to earn their living more easily. Some
could even read and write.</p>

<p>They had learned still more important lessons.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
Mr. Grubb had taught them that it was
unspeakably wicked to kill the poor little babies
as they had been doing, and equally wrong to
bury alive sick people whom they thought would
soon die. He had taught them also that it was
wrong to drink liquor because it made them
frantic and wicked. Though they did not always
do what was right, hundreds of them knew
what was right, and had begun to try to be good.</p>

<p>They knew also&mdash;and this was most important
of all&mdash;about God and Jesus, and, though
none had openly become Christians, the seed
of Christianity had been planted in their hearts.</p>

<p>Now Poit had a special chance to learn what
was right because he was constantly in the company
of Mr. Grubb who had brought about this
wonderful transformation. He was very bright
and Mr. Grubb depended upon him, and he
seemed very faithful and Mr. Grubb trusted
him. He could hunt and set traps, and steal
quietly up to the ostriches and capture them,
and find his way through the woods, and make
bows and arrows, and do other useful things.</p>

<p>When Mr. Grubb had been in the Chaco for
seven years he went home to England for a vacation,
the first vacation he had had. Other
young men had come to help him, and the mission
was so well established that it would not
suffer in his absence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>Before he went away, he planned carefully
for his return. He intended then to visit a distant
tribe called the Toothli, to which Poit belonged,
and he had already built a bullock road
in that direction. He sent Poit to a distant settlement
with seventeen head of cattle and other
goods and told him that he was to settle down
there and make friends with the people. He
was not to sell the cattle to people who would
use them for food, but only to those who would
raise other cattle, because Mr. Grubb was very
anxious for the natives to learn to care for
stock.</p>

<p>Poit was to tell the Toothli that the missionaries
would come and live with them if they
would do certain things. They must give up
making beer, and they must not hold feasts
which lasted more than three days. They must
work when they were called upon for the good
of the whole settlement, and they must help to
build the cart track and keep it clear. They
must live at peace with their neighbors, and
above all they must cease at once the killing of
little children.</p>

<p>Poit had done so well, that this important
work was entrusted to him and off he went with
his cattle and his goods. He was very proud
and at first he obeyed Mr. Grubb's directions.
But alas, his pride in Mr. Grubb's confidence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
and his feeling of responsibility did not continue.
He forgot what he had learned; he convinced
himself that Mr. Grubb was gone for
good; and he took possession of the property
which Mr. Grubb had given him. He began to
sell the cattle to people who used them for food,
and he took the money for himself.</p>

<p>When Mr. Grubb came back, Poit was terrified.
He had not believed Mr. Grubb's promise
nor had he understood in the least how devoted
Mr. Grubb was to his work. Now the money
had to be paid over, and he had to give an account
of the cattle, and he had spent a part of
the money, and the cattle had been eaten. In
order to cover his crime, he stole money from
the missionaries. He was so clever that they
did not at first suspect that he was the thief.
But he could not bring the cattle back to life and
soon he realized that discovery was at hand;
Mr. Grubb would learn that he had not been
faithful.</p>

<p>Mr. Grubb prepared at once to fulfil his
promise to visit the Toothli people, and so little
did he suspect Poit of wrong-doing that he made
him the leader of the six Indians whom he took
with him.</p>

<p>It was so hot that the party traveled by night
to avoid the sun. They had a pretty comfortable
track to walk on, but on both sides were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
thickets of trees and vines in which the twenty-four
kinds of frogs croaked in twenty-four different
notes, and everywhere were mosquitoes
which flew out hungrily when they heard human
beings approaching.</p>

<p>Suddenly Mr. Grubb looked round and saw
that, of all his company, only Poit was in sight.
He sent him back at once to find out why the
others lingered. In a little while Poit reappeared
and reported that one of the bearers had
a thorn in his foot, and his companions were
extracting it. They would all be along, he said,
in a few minutes.</p>

<p>But the few minutes passed and the Indians
did not come. Poit had wickedly told them that
Mr. Grubb did not need them and that they
might return toward the mission. He had
dreamed that when his disobedience was found
out, Mr. Grubb had killed him, and he had decided
in terror that he must kill Mr. Grubb as
soon as possible. He meant to go on for a few
days until they had reached the Toothli country and
then he would do the deed. He believed
that the people of his tribe would help him to
hide his crime.</p>

<p>Mr. Grubb noticed that Poit seemed downcast,
but he did not dream what he had in his
heart. The two went on alone, and still the
other Indians did not overtake them. Poit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
suggested that perhaps they had gone home because
they did not approve of the journey. Still
Mr. Grubb did not suspect his evil intention,
and they traveled on, arriving presently at the
village which was Poit's home.</p>

<p>Here Mr. Grubb inquired about the cattle, but
everybody was in league with Poit and helped
him conceal his theft, and still Mr. Grubb was
deceived. The people said that the cattle had
merely strayed away, and he gave orders that
they be collected before his return.</p>

<p>For two days he and Poit journeyed toward
the distant settlements, and at last Poit decided
that he could postpone the murder no
longer. His heart was depressed when he
woke, because in his sleep he had understood
more clearly than when he was awake what a
fearful thing it was to kill a man who had shown
such love for those who would gladly have been
his enemies.</p>

<p>As he moved about, his courage revived; he
ceased to be downcast and became cheerful. So
cold-blooded was he that he sat beside Mr.
Grubb on the ground while he sharpened the
long iron arrow with which he intended to kill
him.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Barbrooke Grubb</span></p>

<p class="caption">Unarmed and unprotected, he was a messenger of peace to the Indians of Paraguay.</p>

<p>They were now traveling by day, and they set
out at about half-past six for their last journey
together. The sun was already high and so hot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
that it had dried the heavy dew. They had gone
but a short distance when Mr. Grubb saw that
he had been led into a thicket. He observed a
strange look on Poit's face, and did not realize
that he had caught Poit's eye at the moment
when he was trying to get into a position from
which he could shoot him.</p>

<p>A moment later he bent over, trying to break
a path through the undergrowth, and in that
instant Poit lifted his bow and arrow. A stinging
blow under his shoulder blade, and Mr.
Grubb understood in a flash that this was not
his friend but his enemy, and that he had been
shot, perhaps fatally.</p>

<p>When the deed was done, Poit came to himself.
He shouted in dismay and terror, "Ak
kai! Ak kai!" and rushed away.</p>

<p>He had run only a short distance when he
sat down to think. He believed that he had either
killed Mr. Grubb outright or that Mr. Grubb
would soon die from his wounds or that he
would be slain by a jaguar whose tracks they
had crossed. He decided craftily that he would
set out straightway for the mission and say
that he had seen a jaguar about to leap, and
that, shooting at the jaguar, he had killed Mr.
Grubb.</p>

<p>He had not gone very far when he met an
Indian with paint marks on his body, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
showed that he was in mourning. Poit supposed
this meant that Mr. Grubb was dead&mdash;someone
must have found Mr. Grubb's body
before the jaguar devoured it. He ran back
into the forest. By this time he was out of his
mind with fear. For hundreds and hundreds of
years the Indians had killed foreigners without
thinking anything about it; but now there was
a change. Here was an Indian mourning for a
foreigner! Poit was puzzled and frightened.
He did not yet know that all the Indians were
crying out for vengeance upon the man who had
tried to murder their benefactor.</p>

<p>But what neither Poit nor the mourning Indian
knew was that Mr. Grubb was still alive.
How he reached the mission was a miracle. He
was more dead than alive from the wound which
pierced his lung, and from exhaustion. Sometimes
he staggered along leaning on two Indians;
sometimes he rode a horse on whose back
he had to be supported. Often his companions
had to lay him down on the ground lest he
should die. He suffered from the heat by day
and was tortured by the mosquitoes by night.
As though this were not enough, one night a
goat belonging to an Indian jumped on him by
accident!</p>

<p>But at last he reached the mission and had
proper medical attention, and all along the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
weary way the Indians saw his agony and understood
that he was suffering because he had
come to help them. They thought not only of
him, but of the Master about whom he had told
them, and they believed that he had been saved
by a miracle.</p>

<p>Though Mr. Grubb still lived, the Indians decided
that Poit must die, and they searched for
him until they captured him. He pleaded with
them desperately, reminding them that he was
their relative whom they had known all their
lives and that Mr. Grubb was only a stranger;
but they would not listen.</p>

<p>When he heard that Poit was to die, Mr.
Grubb tried to save him, but in vain. He did,
however, succeed in saving Poit's family whom
the Indians would have killed also. This forgiving
spirit amazed and touched them still
more.</p>

<p>Now this story is sad and dreadful and there
would not be any reason for telling it if Poit's
death were the end. But in a way, it was only
a beginning.</p>

<p>Mr. Grubb had to make two journeys for further
medical attention, one to Ascuncion, nearly
four hundred miles away, and one to Buenos
Ayres, nine hundred miles away. It was December
when Poit attacked him; it was June before
he was able to take up his work. When he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
did so, the seed so strangely sown by poor Poit
had ripened. Two Indians who had been impressed
by Mr. Grubb's devotion and by his almost
miraculous recovery asked to be baptized.
Thus the foundation of the Church in the Chaco
was laid.</p>

<p>Mr. Grubb is still working, and the extent of
his influence has greatly increased. The Indians
in the distant settlements no longer wait
for him to seek them out; they come to see for
themselves what he has done and to hear the
story he has to tell. The government has named
him the "pacificator of the Indians."</p>

<p>Do you not suppose that sometimes as he
thinks of his years in the Chaco, he thinks with
pity of poor Poit and hopes that his cry "Ak
kai! Ak kai!" showed repentance as well as
fear of punishment?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ten-year-old</span> Fred Hope looked up at the
men who looked down at him. He was very
happy because he had just taken the pencil and
paper which one of the men handed him, and
written</p>

<p class="blockquot">Fred Hope<span class="space">$1.00</span></p>

<p>He lived on a farm near Flat Rock, Illinois,
and many times he had seen his father sign his
name to a subscription paper when the deacons
had been collecting money for the church and
had made up his mind that some day he would
sign his own name. At last he had done so, and
his eyes were shining.</p>

<p>"Now," said he, "I've got to find a way to
make that dollar."</p>

<p>He took a hoe and some beans and went into
the garden to begin to earn his dollar. He
planted the beans and watched eagerly to see
them grow. It was a bad year for beans in Illinois
and there was no crop. But he did not give
up. From beans he turned to rats. The rats
had been eating his father's grain and Fred
made a contract to rid the place of rats at five
cents apiece. It happened there were more rats<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
than beans in Flat Rock that year and no Indian
chief ever counted with more pride his
scalps of white men than Fred the notches which
numbered the rats he had slain. Soon the dollar
was paid, and his father's grain was safe.</p>

<p>The next money Fred made was to pay his
way to college. When he had almost enough
saved, his mother said:</p>

<p>"Father does not see how he can get along
without you on the farm. He has had a great
deal of trouble and lost a lot of money."</p>

<p>"Of course I'll stay, and I'll find a way to go
to college later on," answered Fred.</p>

<p>When he was twenty-four years old he went
to Maryville College in Tennessee. There he
had to begin with the small boys in the preparatory
department.</p>

<p>"You might just as well give up," said some
of his friends. "You are so far behind you can
never catch up."</p>

<p>But Fred only laughed. "I'll find a way.
When I can't raise beans I always catch rats."</p>

<p>He worked as hard at his lessons as he had on
the farm, and played as well as he worked. He
was the best man on his football team, and when
he graduated he was president of his class.</p>

<p>While he was at school he thought he would
like to be a missionary, but he did not wish to
be a preacher and he had never heard of a missionary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
who was not a preacher. At last he settled
it this way:</p>

<p>"If God wants me to be a missionary and
there is any way I can be a missionary without
being a preacher then I'll be one."</p>

<p>A few years later as a steamer neared the
west coast of Africa, Fred Hope jumped from
one of the berths. He called to his wife to dress
as fast as she could so they should not miss the
first glimpse of the shore.</p>

<p>He had found a way; he was going to Elat on
the west coast of Africa to take charge of the
Frank James Industrial School. As he stood
on the deck in the gray light of the early morning,
he seemed to see John Ludwig Krapf and
Robert Moffat and David Livingstone and all
the men and women who had found a way to
give their lives to Africa, and his heart was
glad.</p>

<p>He could see two white dwelling houses surrounded
by tall coconut-palms and other tropical
plants, beyond the dashing surf at the Batanga
landing. How anxious he was to reach
them! The travelers were lowered to the small
boat in a "Mammy chair," a seat swung by
ropes from the deck of the steamer. Then the
sturdy black men pulled for the shore, their
wet backs gleaming in the sunlight.</p>

<p>A boy who had come from Elat to meet them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
was waiting with two bicycles. Mr. Hope had
never been on a bicycle, so he practised riding
round and round, to the amusement of all the
crowd. Then he and Mrs. Hope started on their
long journey of one hundred and ten miles in
the narrow path through the African jungle.</p>

<p>On either side of them giant trees reached upward
for many, many feet before spreading out
branches to the sunlight above. Underneath the
trees there was no sunshine, only the gloom of
dense foliage. It made them feel as though they
were in a great cathedral,&mdash;the quiet, the great
pillars of the trees, and the dim light.</p>

<p>As they rode on through the villages and the
bush, people crowded round them curiously.
The black men could not speak the white man's
words or make the white man understand their
words. They pointed to Mr. Hope's head.</p>

<p>"They want you to take off your hat so they
can see your straight hair," said the boy.</p>

<p>Mr. Hope took off his hat. They looked at
his straight hair very solemnly. Then they
pointed to Mrs. Hope's head.</p>

<p>"They want to see the hair that is like long
ropes," said the boy. Mrs. Hope took off her
hat.</p>

<p>They moved their hands to their heads and
then far out until she understood that they
wanted her to take out the hairpins and stretch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
her hair as far as it would reach "like long
ropes."</p>

<p>They gazed with wonder at its length and
softness. Then one of them opened his mouth
and pointed first to his teeth and then to Mr.
Hope's mouth. Soon every black man was doing
the same thing.</p>

<p>"They want to see your brass teeth," the boy
explained. Mr. Hope opened his mouth, while
the people who had never heard of a dentist
gazed with much respect at the gold fillings.</p>

<p>"How do the people all along the way know
we are coming?" asked Mr. Hope. "There are
no telegraph wires or telephones."</p>

<p>"By the drums," answered the boy. "Every
village has its drums. They are hollowed out
of logs so the ends make curious sounds that
speak to those who listen. When you pass
through a village the men who beat the drums
call to the next village, 'Strange white man is
here.' All important men have drum names.
Perhaps you will do something so brave they
will give you a drum name some day."</p>

<p>When they reached Elat, Mr. Hope began to
find the work God had provided for a man who
was not a preacher. The missionaries who had
been in Africa said that the boys and men who
went home after being in the mission schools
had nothing to do. There were no stores for
them to run, no factories or shops in which they
could work, and no one had ever taught them
how to farm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>There were not even any decent houses. They
had to live in little huts made out of the bark
of trees, with a dirt floor, no windows, and only
one little door, so low that they had almost to
crawl in. Their houses had only one room, and
in that room all the family cooked and ate and
slept. The chickens stayed in a little room built
at the side of the house. There was no way for
them to get in except through the same door
that led through the house. Often they stopped
to take a peck at the food the women were grinding
between heavy flat stones.</p>

<p>The houses were very dirty. The women had
no time to keep their houses clean; they had to
dig and hoe the ground and harvest the crops
and look after their children and cook the meals.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the men sat round the huts and
smoked and drank and palavered. To "palaver"
means to talk and talk and then talk some
more. Sometimes they went hunting and sometimes
they fought men of other tribes. If they
had known how to work or if it had been the
custom for them to work, they would not have
been so good-for-nothing.</p>

<p>Mr. Hope decided that one of the best deeds
one could do for Africa would be to teach the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
men and boys how to work, to build decent
houses and churches and towns, to make furniture
and clothes, and to use the wonderful natural
gifts God has given to Africa.</p>

<p>The Frank James Industrial School had been
started to do all of these things and half a dozen
boys were there to welcome the new superintendent.
The school building was a little bark
shack much like a native hut. From an industrial
school at Old Calabar Mr. Hope secured a
tailor and a carpenter. He found an old hand
sewing machine which someone had almost
worn out in America and then put into a missionary
box for Africa. Then the boys were
ready to sew.</p>

<p>The first order they took was for clothes for
a party of men who came many miles carrying
burdens. In the interior of Africa there are
no freight or express lines and everything is
carried on the heads or backs of men. These
bearers had come one hundred and twenty-five
miles carrying sixty-five pounds each. They received
one cent a mile for their loads. When
they got their money, Mr. Hope said, "it burned
their pockets, or would have burned them if they
had had any pockets." That was just what they
wanted&mdash;some pockets like the white men. They
wore only pieces of bark cloth tied around their
waists.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>They wanted to spend their money at once
and asked how much they could buy for $1.25.
Mr. Hope told them that would not buy a whole
suit of clothes, so they decided that each of them
would get a coat, since a coat had more pockets
than trousers. The boys in the tailoring school
took their measure for their first order for
"clothes made while you wait."</p>

<p>They waited for a whole week and then went
home each wearing a khaki coat and as happy as
if he had a full outfit. Since that day the tailoring
class has never caught up with its orders.
The men and boys have made clothes for themselves,
for the missionaries and their wives and
children, and for people in the country round
about. They have even made uniforms for army
officials. They can do all this work because now
they have large, plank buildings and machinery
which includes fifteen sewing machines.</p>

<p>But tailoring would not keep everyone busy,
and other things besides clothes were needful,
so Mr. Hope put some of the boys to work in a
carpentry class. Logs of beautiful wood were
brought from the wonderful forests. There
were no great trucks in Elat, so a team of fifteen
or twenty men was made up to haul the logs
to the saw mill and from there they were taken
to the carpenter shop.</p>

<p>At first all the lumber was sawed by hand, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
it took two men all day to saw out half a dozen
planks. Then Mr. Hope wrote to America for
an engine. When the big engine landed at
Batanga the people were very much excited.</p>

<p>"Let us go with you to bring it to Elat," said
several of the men.</p>

<p>"How will we be able to pull such a big engine
that weighs so much?" asked one.</p>

<p>"You are an ignorant man," answered another.
"Do you not know the strange thing that
white men say of this engine?"</p>

<p>"What is it that they say?"</p>

<p>"They say that men need not pull this engine
along the road, but that if men will make fire
in it and put water over the fire the engine will
walk by itself along the road."</p>

<p>When they reached Batanga they helped to
put the water in the boiler and make the fire and
then they saw the engine "walk by itself."</p>

<p>They had traveled about thirty-five miles
along the wide, new road, and Mr. Hope was
thinking how wonderful it would be to have the
big engine at the saw mill, when there was a
crash, and the bridge over the muddy stream
they were crossing went down. The engine
turned over and dropped twenty feet into the
creek below.</p>

<p>Mr. Hope and his friend, who were riding
on the engine, went down with it and were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
thrown to one side. The black men thought
they were killed, for heavy timbers had fallen
all around them, but they soon crawled out alive
and stood looking at their engine lying upside
down in the mud of the little creek.</p>

<p>The black men said the engine could never be
raised from the creek. Mr. Hope only smiled,
and went to work. In a week the engine was
standing on the road ready to walk by itself
again.</p>

<p>Then a message came from the governor saying
the engine would not be allowed to walk
through his country. But even this did not discourage
Mr. Hope. He sent back to Elat for
one hundred men. They came and hitched themselves
to the engine like horses and pulled it all
the long way to Elat, where from that time it
sawed the wood as fast as it was needed. It
was a year from the time they started until they
pulled the engine into Elat.</p>

<p>At first the boys made very simple furniture,
but soon they advanced to dining-room extension
tables, couches, davenports, and bookcases.
Morris chairs were their especial delight, and
they have invented ingenious folding-chairs.</p>

<p>Mr. Hope looked at some American wicker
and willow furniture and said, "We ought to
beat that in Africa, because we have such wonderful
bush-rope in the jungles."</p>

<p class="caption">The boys gathered rattan vines, and Fred Hope showed them how to make attractive
bush-rope furniture.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>So the boys began to gather rattan vines of
different sizes and make it into bush-rope furniture
which was so beautiful that when foreign
officers visited Africa and saw it, they insisted
on taking samples home with them.</p>

<p>Next the boys turned their attention to building
houses. They practised on houses for themselves;
then they built houses for the missionaries.
They decorated Mr. Hope's house with
beautiful mahogany panels made from the trees
that grew right at their door.</p>

<p>When, after a while, the government needed
large warehouses the boys from Elat were able
to build them.</p>

<p>Their greatest triumph was the Elat church.
This is not a little chapel as one might expect
in a mission; it is a church that seats four thousand
people. Not only did they build the church,
but they made all the furniture for it, and the
many thousands of mats of dried grass with
which the roof was covered. Next they went
around the country building other Christian
churches as they were needed.</p>

<p>They learned to make small articles as well
as large. From the tusks of the elephants, which
were not in cages at the Zoo, but at home in the
forests all about, they made ivory chessmen.</p>

<p>Of course, Mr. Hope cannot keep forever the
many boys and men who come to the school.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
Most of them must go back to their own homes.
He wanted them to know how to farm when they
went back, so he laid out a little farm for them
to practise on at the schools, and here they
learn the best methods of planting and cultivating.
They have tried to find new plants which
might grow in Africa. Our own American Agricultural
Bureau became interested in exchanging
plants and seeds, and before long we will
see African vegetables in America and American
vegetables in Africa.</p>

<p>Some boys are taught to become blacksmiths
and in their shop they do everything from putting
a new blade into a pocket-knife to rebuilding
an automobile.</p>

<p>"An automobile!" you say. "Where did
they find it?" It happened in a curious fashion.
Elat was in German territory and when
the Great War began and the Germans were
driven away, they did not wish to leave behind
anything that would be of help to the French
army, so they piled up all their bicycles, motor
cycles, automobiles, and trucks and wrecked
them with sledges and blew them up with dynamite.
To be sure that nothing was left they set
fire to the wreck. The French officers came
along and looked at the pile of scrap iron and
said, "Junk! Nothing worth taking with us,"
and gave it to the mission. When Fred Hope<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
saw it, his eyes shone just as if they had taken
him into a big supply store and said, "Help
yourself." Some people might have shrugged
their shoulders in despair, but Mr. Hope and his
assistant, Mr. Cozzens, set the boys at the school
to work on the junk heap, and out of it they
made an automobile. This model is not to be
bought in the American market, but it has a
number of good points all its own. Then they
made an auto-truck. What was left was made
into a steam engine which runs the shaft that
in turn runs a planer, a boring machine, a shingle
mill, a grinder, and a large lathe.</p>

<p>During the war there was no oil to be had for
the machinery, but Mr. Hope did not stop all the
wheels and cable to America that he would have
to close the school.</p>

<p>"See all these beans growing around us," he
said to his boys. "They are almost like the
castor beans we have in America, and Americans
make oil out of the castor bean. Bring me
a jack from the carpenter shop." The boys ran
to get the jack. "Now, turn it upside down and
make a press out of it."</p>

<p>They mashed the beans until a thick oil ran
out. Then Mr. Hope bought peanuts, not ten
cents worth in a paper sack from the corner
store, but tons from the farms where they grew.
The boys mashed them until barrelfuls of oil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
were stored away. It was a better grade and
much cheaper than the oil they bought from
Europe. Today two hydraulic presses make the
manufacture of oil easy.</p>

<p>"What shall we do now?" asked a boy one
day. "There are no more of the American
brooms."</p>

<p>"Why not make brooms here in our own
school?" said Mr. Hope.</p>

<p>They planted broom-corn seed and it grew so
well that now broom-making is one of the trades
taught at Elat.</p>

<p>During the war there was no soap to be had.
Some people said, "How dreadful!" but Mr.
Hope said, "What good luck! We shall have to
find a way to make our own soap."</p>

<p>He sent to America for lye, and the school
has added soap-making to its other work.</p>

<p>One day the boys asked what they should do
with the shavings in the carpenter shop.</p>

<p>"Burn them," said Mr. Hope. "Burn all of
them."</p>

<p>The foolish boys set fire to them on the dirt
floor of the shop. They were piled up so high
that the roof mats caught fire and in a few
moments there was nothing left of the carpentry
shop but a pile of ashes and a few blackened
tools.</p>

<p>But almost before the ashes were cold, Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
Hope started the remorseful boys to building
another shop, and in less than a week they were
back at work.</p>

<p>Many of the young men who came to the
school were married, and Mr. Hope decided that
he would build a town where each man who attended
school could live in his own home. His
town now has houses on each side of the street
and more than one hundred families live there.
In the afternoons, Mrs. Hope has classes for the
girls and women. She teaches them to cook and
to sew, to read and to write, and to take care of
their children.</p>

<p>After the boys and men and their wives have
finished their training in the schools, they go
back to their own villages. Often they build
themselves a home. The chief is sure to be interested
in a man who has a house better than
his own, so the mission boys become men of
importance.</p>

<p>Hundreds of boys have been turned away
from the school because they could not be accommodated.
Only the strongest Christian
boys are chosen. These boys come from all
parts of the mission and are recommended for
admission by the missionaries who know them.</p>

<p class="caption">His steadfastness and perseverance won for him from
the Africans the name, "Tree-Not-Shaken-by-the-Wind."</p>

<p>Frequently the boys themselves become missionaries.
They build churches and tell the people
the wonderful story of the "Tribe of God"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
to which they belong. Many of them start
schools. None of them sit around their huts all
day and smoke and drink and beat their wives
and quarrel, as their fathers and grandfathers
used to do. While they learn their trades, they
become better Christians, not only because they
listen to the preaching on Sunday, but because
they watch Mr. and Mrs. Hope and the other
missionaries and see how they live.</p>

<p>Fred Hope said he would be a missionary if
he could be one without being a preacher, yet
he preaches every day. Sometimes he ventures
to stand up in church or among the people who
crowd the doors of the mission, and tell them
the story of the Son of God who gave Himself
for them, but most of his preaching is his every-day
living.</p>

<p>He has won his "drum name." He began to
win it when he paid his pledge for $1.00 by
catching rats when his bean crop failed, and
always since then he has found some way to do
the things that he undertakes no matter how
hard they are or how many difficulties he meets.</p>

<p>If you were in an African village which Mr.
Hope was about to visit, you would not be
handed a telegram stating "Fred Hope has arrived,"
but instead, you would hear the drums
beat the call, "'Tree-Not-Shaken-by-the-Wind'
is here."</p>

<small>WHEN MARY WAS AFRAID</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> night was gloomy and rain threatened,
yet there were many boys and girls on Queen
Street in Dundee. They were doing nothing in
particular; they did not seem to be on their
way anywhere; they were simply hanging
about.</p>

<p>Opening into Queen Street were courts called
"pends" or "closes." These were not streets,
for they were very narrow, or thoroughfares,
because they led nowhere; they were merely
vestibules to tall buildings where human beings
lived huddled together like animals. They
were paved with rough stones, and in order to
reach the spiral staircase on the outside of the
old tenements one had to step through masses
of filth.</p>

<p>Even so, these boys and girls found the pend
and the gateway into the street and the street
itself a pleasant change from the crowded rooms
in which they lived. All day they worked in
factories, and in the evening they naturally
tried to find entertainment.</p>

<p>This evening they were in a good humor, and
it was very plain that they were awaiting some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
interesting event. They looked down the street
eagerly as one might look for the approach of
the band at the head of a circus parade. Presently
they drew near together before the door
of a little room on the ground floor of Queen
Street. The window-shades were lifted and
within were to be seen rows of benches and a
little table. They looked in and laughed.</p>

<p>"We'll get her!" said a rough voice. "Just
wait till she comes to her prayer-meeting!"</p>

<p>So it was not for a circus parade they were
watching!</p>

<p>"She wants to go out to Africa to teach black
people!" said another, and there were shrieks
of laughter as though this were the strangest
desire ever heard of.</p>

<p>"Black people!" repeated the largest boy of
all. "I'll black her eye." As he spoke he swung
a heavy object at the end of a string. It looked
like a piece of lead and was a dangerous
weapon.</p>

<p>At this moment a figure appeared at the corner
and advanced toward the group.</p>

<p>"She's coming!" shouted a girl. "She's
coming!"</p>

<p>There was delighted laughter and a sudden
stooping to the earth. There were loose stones
on Queen Street and there was also mud, both
soft, sticky mud and hard, dried mud.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>"We'll do for her!" cried another girl.</p>

<p>"We'll make her let us alone."</p>

<p>"I'm a good shot."</p>

<p>A foe worthy of these many fierce opponents
should have been tall and strong and well-armed,
but the approaching figure was that of
a girl. Her name was Mary Slessor; she was
fourteen years old and short for her age. She
had not had a chance to grow to her full height
because she got up at five o'clock in the morning,
helped her mother until she went to the
factory at six, worked until six in the evening,
and then helped her mother until a late bedtime.
When she had a spare moment she read, even
propping her book up on her loom as the great
missionary Livingstone had done when he was
a factory boy.</p>

<p>The shouts of the boys and girls grew louder.</p>

<p>"Hi, Mary Slessor!"</p>

<p>"Hit her!"</p>

<p>"You let us alone, or we'll do for you!"</p>

<p>The little figure came straight on.</p>

<p>"We're not going to come to your meetings!"
shouted a loud voice.</p>

<p>"We don't care for your meetings!" yelled
another.</p>

<p>"You clear right out of here!" howled a
third.</p>

<p>Still the little figure advanced.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>"I won't give up," she shouted back, white-faced
and stubborn. "You can do what you
like; I won't give up!"</p>

<p>In answer to this defiance there was a moment's
silence. Then the largest boy stepped
out with his weight tied to a cord in his hand.</p>

<p>"All right," he said. "Then look out for
your head!"</p>

<p>His companions moved back out of danger,
and he began to swing the lead round and round.</p>

<p>"You can't frighten me," said Mary. "I'm
going to go to the meetings and I'm going to
invite you to the meetings. You can't stop me."</p>

<p>She stood perfectly still. The tall boy moved
nearer. He lifted his arm and began to swing
the piece of lead round and round in the air.
It passed within six inches of Mary's face; another
swing, and it was within four inches. Now
it touched a flying tendril of her hair. Another
swing and it might kill her.</p>

<p>But the boy dropped his arm and let the cruel
weapon fall. For the first time in his unruly
life he had been beaten&mdash;not by force, but by
love.</p>

<p>"Let her alone," he said gruffly. "She's
game."</p>

<p>A little color came into Mary's pale cheeks.
Most persons would have been satisfied with
this victory, but Mary was not. She boldly repeated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
the crime for which she had been so
nearly punished.</p>

<p>"Will you come to my meeting?" she asked.</p>

<p>The leader put both hands into his pockets.</p>

<p>"Well, this beats me!" he said. His companions
expected that now Mary Slessor's hour
had come. Instead, he turned on them furiously.</p>

<p>"Go on in!" he commanded, and into the
meeting filed the whole party.</p>

<p>It was not this time that Mary was afraid.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In far-off Calabar in Africa in the deep woods
there was a stir. Dawn was not yet complete,
though there was a grayish light over everything
and a pink glow in the eastern sky. The
trees were tall, the foliage dark, and here and
there were gorgeous flowers. Now and then a
parrot or a monkey chattered high up on the
branches. Near by flowed a beautiful stream,
overshadowed by thick foliage and edged by
blooming water-lilies.</p>

<p>So far everything was beautiful. But in the
deep thickets there were sounds which were not
beautiful, the angry shouts of harsh, human
voices. Advancing through the bushes were
many black men, wearing almost no clothing,
but armed to the teeth. They carried knives in
their belts and spears and guns in their hands.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
Their black eyes glittered, their teeth gleamed,
they panted for breath. They were on the war-path,
and they looked as terrible as charging
beasts of prey. They were a tribe of the Okoyong
country, going to meet in battle another
tribe, a member of which had injured their
chief. Nothing one would have said could stay
them.</p>

<p>Suddenly they heard a sound of advancing
footsteps and a shrill call. They tightened their
grasp on their weapons. Was the enemy at
hand? Then up and at him!</p>

<p>But it was not an enemy; the voice was not
that of a warrior; it was that of a woman. It
was not even that of a woman of Okoyong; it
was that of a white woman. "Stop!" it called,
in the language of the Okoyong. "Stop! Listen
to me!"</p>

<p>There came into view a little woman who
looked, in spite of the passing of many years,
like the girl who had defied the boys in Queen
Street. She was not much taller and certainly
no stouter. Her hair was bobbed like a boy's,
and this made her look much as she had long
ago. It was undoubtedly Mary Slessor.</p>

<p>She advanced rapidly, running over the
ground in bare feet. One could not keep one's
shoes dry in the damp grass, and it was better
to go unshod.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span></p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">A West Coast African Village</span></p>

<p class="caption">Living in a native mud hut, eating the same sort of food, and sharing their every-day life,
Mary Slessor became the beloved "White Queen of Okoyong."</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>"Stop!" she called again. "Listen to me!"</p>

<p>"Ma is coming!" said a dozen angry voices.</p>

<p>"She needn't think she can stop us with any
of her peace talk!"</p>

<p>"Disgrace has been put upon us," said another.
"We must have vengeance."</p>

<p>The warriors shook their heads impatiently.
They would listen, but they would not obey.
The little figure came nearer and nearer and
stood at last regarding them.</p>

<p>Calabar was not only one of the most beautiful
places in the world, it was one of the most
terrible. Just as into the pends and closes of
Dundee had crowded all the poor and wretched
beings who could not afford to live elsewhere,
so into Calabar had drifted the most ignorant,
the most degraded, the most persecuted of the
black men on the West Coast. On one side the
water prevented them from going farther; not
far away from the other side was the desert.
From the sea came a terrible enemy, the slave-trader,
who seized thousands of victims and carried
them away to die in misery in his ships or
to serve hard masters in distant lands. The
country was under the control of England, but
no white men penetrated it to face death from
starvation, fever, or the bullet or poisoned arrow
or spear-tip of a warrior.</p>

<p>Missionaries try to speak as kindly as possible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
about the people among whom they work,
but for these poor Africans they had only
dreadful words, "bloody," "savage," "cruel,"
"crafty," "devilish," "cannibals," "murderers."
They did their best for them along the
coast, but their efforts to penetrate inland were
in vain. It was no wonder they were "bloody,"
"savage," and "cruel," since the white man
whom the Africans knew was a demon who
stole men, who taught them new ways of murdering
one another, and who brought them rum
which made beasts of them.</p>

<p>Most fierce and terrible of all the tribes and
most dangerous to the white man were the
Okoyong whose watchword seemed to be
"war." They fought among themselves in
their own villages and in various tribes; but
most of all they fought the surrounding nations.
The life of a warrior from Calabar was not
worth an instant's purchase if he appeared on
their borders.</p>

<p>But into this country Mary Slessor had gone,
and here she was at dawn, alone, facing a tribe
of angry men&mdash;not only facing them, but giving
them orders.</p>

<p>She had left Scotland and had lived for a
while in the mission school at Duke Town near
the coast where all was orderly, and there had
learned the language. Now she lived in a mud<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
hut and ate the food of the natives, partly so
that she might have a large share of her salary
to send home to her mother, and partly because
she wanted to learn the hearts of the native men
and women and the secret of their dreadful customs.
If she knew why they believed it necessary
to kill the wives of a chief when he died
and put their bodies with his into the grave, if
she knew why they threw poor little twin babies
into the bushes to die, if she knew why they
offered human sacrifices,&mdash;then she might be
able to persuade them to understand their own
wickedness.</p>

<p>She asked at last to be sent to Okoyong, and
here she was alone, so far as white companionship
was concerned, but with many black companions.
She had even adopted a family, all
of them black. One was a little girl, brought to
her by a white trader.</p>

<p>"I found this tiny baby thing in the bush,"
he said. "It is a twin, and the other is dead."</p>

<p>Mary called the baby Janie for her sister in
Scotland. Finally she had seven, who would
otherwise have died and whom she nursed and
taught and trained.</p>

<p>The Okoyong, who would not have endured
the presence of a man, tolerated her. She lived
at first in the king's hut, where they were able
to watch her day and night. They believed that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
she could do them no harm, and they were willing
to let her prescribe for their illnesses and
try to heal their poor bodies. They called her
"Ma," and when she did not oppose their customs,
they obeyed her.</p>

<p>But Mary Slessor was not one to countenance
evil, or to step aside from a path which she had
set for herself. When she saw prisoners about
to be tortured, not as punishment, but merely
as a test of their innocence, she protested and
argued and scolded until the chief reconsidered.
When human sacrifices were to be offered after
the death of a young chief, she grew frantic;
she mocked and commanded and even slept beside
the prisoners so that they should not be
murdered, and she helped them escape. She
arbitrated quarrels, she proved the witch-doctors
to be impostors. Day in and day out she
preached of a Kingdom of Love until the natives
began to understand what it would be
to live at peace with their fellows, to be free
from fear and superstition, and to have hope in
God.</p>

<p>The government sent no consul into the district
but appointed Mary Slessor to be consul,
and she sat in distant villages and heard disputes
and debated with great chiefs about
proper punishment for criminals, about trade,
and about matters in dispute between the natives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
and the government. She was called "The
White Queen of Okoyong."</p>

<p>Now she was growing old; her little body was
racked by ague; she was often so tired that she
did not see how she could live, but she saw her
work prospering. It was necessary for her to
have a rest, and she was about to leave. She
was packing her few belongings and the river
steamer was almost at hand.</p>

<p>But at the last minute there came to her a
message. It was a secret; she did not know who
brought it. A chief had been injured by a man
from another tribe, and his own tribesmen were
on their way to avenge him.</p>

<p>She did not hesitate for an instant, unless it
was to look at a picture which hung on the wall
of her little hut. It was the likeness of a young
man, the boy who had once defied her in Queen
Street in Dundee and had flung his leaden
weight round her head. From the moment when
he had entered her meeting he had led a better
life, and he had sent her his picture and that of
his wife and children to show her how prosperous
they were. With the recollection of that
courageous stand in her mind, she set out on her
journey. She might miss the boat and not get
home, but that made no difference. How could
she rest if she knew that behind her all her work
was being undone?</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>The chief men of the village opposed her
going.</p>

<p>"They will kill you."</p>

<p>"They are mad, they will shoot wildly. If
you are not assassinated, you will be shot by
accident."</p>

<p>"They will insult you in their drunken rage."</p>

<p>But Mary shook her head and started, a man
going before her beating a drum to show that
a free protected person was coming. She
marched straight to the village and there
the warriors deceived her. They were going to
start out in the morning, but they said they
would call her and she might go with them. In
the morning they called her as they had promised,
but not until they were ready to start.
By the time she had quickly sprung up from
the earth where she was sleeping, the warriors
were off.</p>

<p>They showed great stupidity, however, when
they believed that they could get rid of Mary
Slessor in this fashion. A hundred yards away
she caught up to them and now she stood calling
to them like the sign-post which warns of the
danger of the rushing train, "Stop! Listen!"
This danger was worse than that threatened by
any rushing train. They began to howl and yell.</p>

<p>Mary looked at them scornfully. She knew
how to talk to them.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>"Don't carry on like small boys!" she said.
"Be quiet."</p>

<p>To their amazement, she walked straight
through their ranks and on to the village where
the enemy was drawn up in battle array.</p>

<p>"I salute you," she said.</p>

<p>The enemy were too much astonished and
enraged to answer.</p>

<p>"Where are your manners?" she said chidingly.
She began to smile and joke.</p>

<p>At once an old man stepped out and knelt
down at her feet. Here was one person at least
with manners.</p>

<p>"Once when I was sick you came to see me
and healed me. This is a foolish quarrel. We
beg you to make peace for us." If Mary had
been presented with a million dollars, she
wouldn't have been so happy.</p>

<p>"You bring three men," she commanded,
"and three men will come from the other side,
and we will have a palaver."</p>

<p>For hours she listened to their story; she
coaxed them and commanded them and pleaded
with them and laughed at them. In the end
she conquered, and they made peace. Then she
said a few simple words about her Saviour and
went back over the dark, lonely forest path.
The boat had gone, but messengers were waiting
to take her down the river in a canoe.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>It was not this time that Mary Slessor was
afraid, but the time was coming nearer.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The afternoon was pleasant and at Duke
Town, along the coast of Calabar, there was a
stir which betokened some unusual event. The
chief missionary, Mr. MacGregor, was moving
about busily, now in the missionary buildings,
now in his own house. The Governor General
and the Commissioner sat on their porches looking
out as though they were watching for something
or somebody, or waiting for something to
begin. When Europeans met, they stopped and
said a joking word to one another.</p>

<p>It was more than thirty years since Mary
Slessor had landed in Duke Town, and there
were many changes. The government buildings
were larger and finer, the mission buildings had
increased in number and size, and there were
many other improvements. England had begun
to busy herself with the affairs of her colony,
and the Church at home was listening to the desperate
call from Calabar.</p>

<p>Presently a long line of boys appeared from
the Boys' School and filed into the hall of the
mission buildings. Then there came an equally
long file from the Girls' School. At once the
chief missionary and the other missionaries and
the Governor General and the Commissioner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
went thither also, followed by the Europeans
and the natives.</p>

<p>They took their assigned places on the platform
and the benches and sat waiting. They
watched the door even as the naughty boys and
girls had looked up the street in Dundee, and
as the Okoyong chiefs had looked out from between
the branches.</p>

<p>"She's coming!" said a whisper. The whisper
passed all along the benches. "She's coming!
She's coming!"</p>

<p>A little figure advanced to the platform, hesitated,
and moved on, assisted by firm and
tender hands, and urged by laughing voices.</p>

<p>"Now, come along, Ma! Are you afraid,
Ma?"</p>

<p>It must be confessed that now at last Mary
Slessor was afraid; afraid of all these eyes,
though she was accustomed to facing thousands
of eyes set in black faces; afraid of all these
smiles, though she was accustomed to friendliness.
Most of all, she was afraid of what was
being said. Almost before she was seated, the
Commissioner began to speak.</p>

<p>"Miss Slessor, I have in my hand a box which
contains a silver badge of the Order of the Hospital
of St. John of Jerusalem in England, of
which the King is the sovereign head. This
badge is conferred only on persons professing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
the Christian faith, who are eminently distinguished
for philanthropy. It is a Maltese cross,
embellished in the angles by lions and unicorns.
I have been directed by the King to bestow this
badge upon you in recognition of your service
to the government. You have opened the country
of Okoyong; you, above all others, have been
instrumental in preserving peace; you have let
in a great light where there was darkness; and
England thanks you, her only woman consul."</p>

<p>Mary not only was afraid, but she looked
afraid. Her head bent lower and lower, her
hands were lifted to hide her face. But at last
she had to rise and have the medal pinned on
her shoulder. She stood for a moment, trembling;
then she looked down at the pleased, attentive
faces. She saw herself a little girl in
Scotland and then a woman in Africa, and once
again she grew calm and brave and even a little
ashamed of her embarrassment. The credit for
what she had done was not hers, she would tell
where it belonged; then she would feel comfortable.</p>

<p>"If I have done anything in my life," she
said, "it has been easy, because the Master has
gone before."</p>

<p>Then she sat down neither proud nor afraid,
but content.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">VI<br />

<small>THE BOY FOR WHOM NO ONE CARED</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Within</span> the livery stable in Harrisburg there
was the sound of rough voices and the tramp
of horses' feet. Outside the rain fell steadily.
It was six o'clock on a December morning, and
the sky was still black.</p>

<p>Christmas was only a few days off. David
Day, who worked in the stable, anticipated
neither a holiday nor a Christmas dinner. It
was during the Civil War, and hither were
brought the faithful, worn cavalry and artillery
horses which were then taken into neighboring
counties and exchanged for fresh farm horses.</p>

<p>A large consignment had come in the evening
before, and David had helped to lead them to
their places. He was dreaming of them as he
lay on a pile of straw with a horse-blanket for
his only covering.</p>

<p>Suddenly a rough voice called, "Dave!
Dave!" and he started up from his straw bed.
"It's time to start. Are you going to lie there
all day?"</p>

<p>As he fastened his clothing, the loosening of
which had been his only preparation for the
night, David's lips quivered. The cold, his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
weariness of body, the glimpses he caught as he
wandered about the town of other people's happiness&mdash;all
were bad enough, but he could stand
them if it were not for the dreadful loneliness
of his heart.</p>

<p>"If there were only one person in the world
who cared for me!" he thought. "One person
to whom it made any difference whether I came
or went. That is all I ask."</p>

<p>He found his fellow hostlers gathered together
eating their rough breakfast by the dim
light of lanterns. They were soldiers, detailed
for this duty, and were dressed in faded blue
uniforms. All were hard-working, harshly-spoken
men older than David. They did not
mean to be unkind; such treatment as they gave
him was that to which they were accustomed.</p>

<p>This morning the rough commands, the oaths,
the prospect of riding out into the rain and
being in a few minutes drenched to the skin
seemed to David more dreary than ever. He
had a hope which usually sustained him, the
hope of continuing his education and becoming
a preacher and perhaps a missionary; but this
morning his sky was dark. He mounted his
horse and rode out the gate directing with his
voice a hundred poor, dispirited, patient beasts,
some of whom still bore the healed or only partially
healed scars of battle-wounds.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>By this time his misery was so keen that he
said aloud, "If I only had someone to care for
me!"</p>

<p>There was no answer, and he rode on.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Six years had passed and again the rain fell
heavily. That which seemed miraculous had
happened. David had gone to school; friends
had been raised up for him, he had become a
preacher and, still more wonderful, a missionary.
He had gone, not to India as he had expected,
but to Liberia on the west coast of
Africa. Liberia is a republic, founded as a
home for colored people who wished to return
from the United States to their native land. On
the seacoast there was civilization, but only a
little way inland the darkness of heathendom
grew dense. Here David's church had a mission,
and here David and his wife had just
arrived.</p>

<p>The rain was not a steady winter rain like
that into which he had ridden with his horses;
it was much heavier, and it was also more irregular.
For a half-hour the downpour shut
out everything in sight; then the sun shone
brightly, and in a few minutes a thick mist rose
from the steaming earth. A little while and the
same process was repeated, and so on all day
long.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>David and his wife left the little steamer
which ran part way to the mission and walked
up the path preceded by the bearers who carried
their luggage. They expected to find a
comfortable house with food in the larder provided
for them by their predecessor, who had
had to return home on account of failing health.</p>

<p>They saw only the path before them; they
did not see bright eyes peering from among the
dark leaves, glittering, bright eyes which looked
like a queer variety of fruit or blossom. The
eyes watched them cross the overgrown clearing
before the mission house and climb the steps.
The porters set down their loads, received their
pay, and turned back into the wall of mist, and
the two young people stood alone. The black
eyes could not see the faces of the newcomers
and did not dream of the consternation expressed
there. To them, the mission house,
even in its present state, was a grand palace.</p>

<p>David and his wife walked into the hall and
saw that the rain had come through the roof,
through the ceiling, clear down to the first floor.
The departure of the last missionary had to be
made so hurriedly that there had been no time
to protect anything from moisture or from destructive
insects. The furniture looked unsafe,
the walls were covered with mould, and there
was naturally no food anywhere about.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>But they had brought some food with them,
and they sat down on rickety chairs before a
rickety table to eat. The sun which had shone
so brilliantly for a few minutes vanished; there
was a noise like thunder on the roof, and darkness
fell with the rain, though night was still
far away. As they ate, their spirits rose.</p>

<p>"We are pioneers," said Mrs. Day.</p>

<p>"Not quite," said David. "Pioneers do not
have even as much of a roof as this." Suddenly
he laughed and went to the side of the room
where their luggage was stacked. He opened
an umbrella and held it over Mrs. Day's head
upon which the rain had begun to drip. "Nor
umbrellas!" said he.</p>

<p>Mrs. Day laughed, and her laugh made David
for some strange reason sober.</p>

<p>"Why, your eyes are full of tears!" said she.
"There isn't anything to cry about!"</p>

<p>David did not explain; he continued to eat
with one hand while he held the umbrella with
the other. His tears were not tears of sorrow,
but tears of joy. Said he to himself:</p>

<p>"I used to say, 'If only I had someone to
care for me!' and now I have."</p>

<p>But his heart was not at rest. When the supper
was finished, he walked to the door and
looked out. Again the thunder of the rain had
ceased, the sun was shining brightly, and mist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
was rising from the earth. He could see with
his mind's eye the thick jungle extending hundreds
of miles away and growing darker and
darker. It was not the thought of the jungle
which troubled him, but of the inhabitants
whose hearts were darker than their skins,
darker than the shadows of night which would
soon settle down. He had now a new question
to trouble his peace.</p>

<p>"What can one man do?" he said to himself.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Ten more years passed, and this morning the
sun shone clear and unclouded. The rains were
over, and fine weather was certain for weeks
to come. David remembered as he rose that
the eleventh anniversary of his coming to Africa
had passed unnoticed. He had an important
matter on his mind and he dressed quickly and
came and stood at the doorway of the mission
house, waiting a little impatiently for his
breakfast.</p>

<p>The mission house had changed in appearance;
the roof was sound and the floor safe to
walk upon and there was comfortable furniture
everywhere. Even more changed was the aspect
of everything without. It seemed as though
on all sides the jungle had been pushed back and
the sunlight had been let in. Before the mission
house was a garden; near by stood a chapel;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
here were dormitories; there were workshops.
Surrounding the mission grounds were plantations
of coffee trees.</p>

<p>Not only were there pleasant things to look
at, but there were pleasant things to hear, the
sound of children singing, the cheerful jingling
of the breakfast dishes, and, above all, the soft
pleasant splash of the waterfall in the river.</p>

<p>There were even funny sounds. A pet monkey
sat on the porch railing and chattered at
David&mdash;whom, by the way, we should now call
Mr. Day. The poor monkey had yesterday
learned a lesson which all naughty creatures
must learn, to keep his hands away from that
which did not belong to him. His aim in life
was mischief; he liked to steal, to tear down
pictures from the wall, to open ink bottles and
smear ink over nice clean paper, or, better still,
over paper which had been laboriously covered
with reports.</p>

<p>But yesterday, in hunting for ink, he had
opened a bottle of strong ammonia. For a moment
he had been paralyzed by the fumes, then
he coughed and sputtered and scolded and
screamed and ran to the top of one of the tall
palm trees in front of the house. He would
never open any more bottles! He seemed to
be saying so as he chattered.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Old Mission Chapel Built by Dr. Day, and his Coffee Industry</span></p>

<p class="caption">Dr. Day believed that not only must men be taught about Jesus, but they must be given
work to keep them busy and create self-respect.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>After breakfast a bell rang, and Mr. Day
hurried to the chapel. It was time for prayers,
and then he would get at his important task.
He had, besides a loving heart, a good head, and
he believed that it was not enough to teach men
about Jesus and to persuade them to have faith
in Him. One must also give them work to do
so that their minds and hands might be occupied
and they might be self-respecting and
busy. Then the tempter would not be able to
win them back to sin.</p>

<p>Each boy and girl and each man and woman
in the mission had a task. In the first place
they went to school, and hundreds had learned
to read the Bible, some so well that they could
teach others. They did the work in the mission
house and on the coffee plantations, they toted
the baggage, and they farmed for themselves.</p>

<p>Mr. Day not only believed that they should
work, but he believed that they should have good
tools and labor-saving devices just as the white
people had, and this morning a long-looked-for
steam engine was to be set in place. There was
no use to try to have any other work done, or
even to keep school. Mr. Day was excited, but
he was the least excited of all the people for
miles around.</p>

<p>He conducted chapel soberly, and then he
went down to the river, followed by a great
crowd. There were little girls in neat gingham<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
dresses and little boys in white cotton trousers
and shirts and older folks who were also clean
and neatly dressed. Behind them came another
throng who lived near by, but who did not belong
to the mission. At their head was a chief
who had fixed himself up for the occasion by
borrowing all the clothing his friends owned.
He wore shoes which were too tight, and consequently
he took mincing, awkward steps. The
rest of his wardrobe consisted of three heavy
coats, the lower one very long, the upper one cut
off so as to show the tails of the other two, and
a high paper collar.</p>

<p>Like all the rest, he was afraid of the large
object which lay at the landing. Not much of
it was to be seen through the crate which covered
it, but he could tell that it was black and
dangerous looking. He muttered as he went
along.</p>

<p>"We no made for do dis ting. 'Merican man
got dat sense. Country man too fool; no sava
(know) dem ting called steam. Sava cook, sava
eat, sava rice; but dis ting pass him."</p>

<p>As they approached the river's edge, the men
of the mission pressed forward to the side of
Mr. Day, whom they called Daddy. They were
very proud of their importance, but they were
half afraid. Daddy was already fastening the
ropes to the boat in which the engine rested.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>"Now, boys, pull her up!" he called.</p>

<p>There was giggling and laughing as a hundred
hands laid hold on the ropes. There was
also a great deal of boasting, such as boys do
in our country.</p>

<p>"Me strong man!"</p>

<p>"Me pull powerful!"</p>

<p>"Dis ting nosing! Me pull whole house."</p>

<p>"Me pull whole tree down!"</p>

<p>"Ready, all together!" called Daddy.</p>

<p>In a few minutes the boat was high up on the
sand beside a strong tripod of poles and the
mission wagon which had been placed there.
With still louder shouts the heavy box was
swung into the wagon. There was laughter and
more boasting.</p>

<p>"Me pull strongest of all!"</p>

<p>But now came the tug-of-war. The wagon
sank deep into the soft soil and when it would
not move, each black man let go the rope and
began to shout reproaches at his mate.</p>

<p>"You no work!"</p>

<p>"You weak man!"</p>

<p>"You little baby!"</p>

<p>Daddy was for a moment in despair. Then
his ever-ready smile returned, and he said to a
bystander, "Get a drum."</p>

<p>The drummer began to beat, the crowd began
to sing, the boys and girls began to dance, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
the wagon moved. The rope was so long that
the women and children could take hold. In a
little while the engine had come to the end of its
long journey from York, Pennsylvania, to Muhlenberg
Mission, Africa.</p>

<p>But it was not yet set up, and Mr. Day was
puzzled. He stood earnestly reading the directions,
and then he began to give orders. He was
so pressed upon by the crowd that he had to
shout to them to stand back.</p>

<p>A smart mission boy read the number on the
engine.</p>

<p>"Him say, 'No two four one seven.' That
him name."</p>

<p>They were all so busy with their own thoughts
that they did not see that the last section of the
engine was in place and that Daddy had filled
the boiler with water.</p>

<p>Suddenly a black boy began to yell.</p>

<p>"Daddy burn him engine up! Daddy burn
him engine up!"</p>

<p>Daddy smiled again and piled under the
boiler the splintered wood from the crate. The
fire grew hotter and hotter, the people forgot
their fear and pressed closer and closer.</p>

<p>Daddy was elated; for years he had prayed
for this engine, and for months he had known
that it was coming and had wondered whether
he would be able to set it up and run it. Now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
here it was, put together, and with the steam
pressure mounting higher and higher. He could
not express his joy, but he had something at
hand which could. He supposed that this fine
engine had a fine whistle and he opened the
valve and set it off.</p>

<p>Such a sound had never been heard in that
part of the world. It was shriller than the
monkey's chatter; it was more penetrating than
the roll of the war-drums. Men, women, children&mdash;everybody&mdash;ran
for the woods. Even the
goats and the chickens fled. Daddy laughed and
laughed, and presently they began to venture
back.</p>

<p>"How he live for (does he) holler?" asked
one.</p>

<p>"He shoot off wif he mouf!"</p>

<p>"Daddy say he have biler. Where de biler?"</p>

<p>"Yonder de biler!" And half a dozen fingers
pointed to the smoke-stack.</p>

<p>Daddy let the fire go down and went back to
the mission porch. It was almost noon, and the
hot sun commanded all men with white skins to
get under cover. He sat down to tell his friends
in America that the engine was in place, and, as
he wrote, he remembered his arrival at the mission,
its desolation, the sinking of his heart.
His pen dropped from his fingers.</p>

<p>One man had, after all, done a great deal.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>Mr. Day had, after awhile, a new title, given
to him by a college at home. First he had been
Dave, then David, then he had been the Reverend
Mr. Day, then "Daddy," and now he was
"the Reverend Doctor Day." Probably he liked
"Daddy" best of all.</p>

<p>He had ceased entirely as he grew older to
think about other people caring for him; what
he wished for was to care for other people. He
had had many to love, the dear wife who worked
with him, and two babies whom they could only
keep for a little while. Then there was Leila, a
little daughter who was brought up in America.
When she was nine years old she went to Africa,
but lived only a short time.</p>

<p>He had also hundreds, even thousands, of
black boys and girls and men and women, those
who came to the mission as children and married
there and bought themselves little farms
near by, and those who came and stayed only a
little while and then went back to the jungle.
Of these, some forgot all they had learned, except
one thing, that here was a man who had
come from so far away that they could not measure
the distance, simply to do them good.</p>

<p>For twenty-three years Dr. Day worked on,
almost without rest. Mrs. Day came home to
America, worn-out, but with high courage to
the end of her life. She would not let anyone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
say that she would not get well and that she
could not go back and work with Dr. Day.</p>

<p>"In Africa everything depends on how brave
you are. I expect to go back."</p>

<p>Dr. Day saw many of the missionaries who
came to help him fall by his side; he saw his
first native helpers grow old and die, but he was
as brave as Mrs. Day.</p>

<p>"This is my work," he would say. "I need
no rest. This is my place."</p>

<p>In 1896 he came home. It was December, and
more than thirty years had passed since that
December day when he had started out in the
bleak morning leading his poor horses. He
traveled on a fast steamer, but it was clearly
to be seen that before he reached the dock he
would have started on another journey. The
friends who came to meet him found only his
tired body.</p>

<p>But all over the country hearts ached and
ached, from Maine to California and from Canada
to Florida, and out in Africa there was
mourning. It was hard to realize that this was
the boy who, when he was young, had wished
so desperately for "just one person to care for
him." Now thousands cared for him. The
explanation is very simple, so simple that any
child can understand and can imitate him. It
is this&mdash;he cared for others.</p>

<small>UNDER TWO FLAGS</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was New Year's Eve in China, even though
the calendar on Jennie Crawford's desk in the
hospital in the city of Hanyang said, "January
31, 1911." Three years ago, she had left her
home in Lynn, Massachusetts, to go to Hanyang
because there were more nurses in the state of
Massachusetts than in all the great Chinese
Empire.</p>

<p>"If I should live in China fifty years," she
said to herself as she looked at her calendar,
"I'd never get used to February first or any
other day than the first day of January being
New Year's Day. It seems so strange to have
a different day every year and none of them
January first."</p>

<p>She walked to the window and looked out.
The night was stormy. Loud peals of thunder
startled the people who hurried along the
streets, and occasional flashes of lightning illuminated
the crowds gathered there.</p>

<p>"It's not a good sign for the New Year," said
one old Chinese to another. "When it thunders
on New Year's Eve there will be a bad year!"</p>

<p>"We must make sure tonight that the evil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
spirits are all frightened away," answered his
friend. "We must take no chances on any being
left to get into the New Year."</p>

<p>The two men joined the crowd who were beating
gongs and setting off firecrackers. Here
and there Buddhist priests went up and down,
urging the people to make just as much noise
as possible.</p>

<p>Inside the houses mothers were trying to
rouse their sleepy children because, unless the
whole family kept awake and very watchful, the
evil spirits would get into the houses and stay
all the year. When the sleepy children could no
longer hold their tired eyes open, their mothers
hurriedly fed them a vegetable with a bad odor
so that the spirits might be frightened away.</p>

<p>New Year's Day was clear and beautiful, and
all China had holiday. The shops were closed,
and the houses were decorated with strips of
red paper inscribed with Chinese characters
which meant "happiness," "long life," and
other blessings. On most of the doors were
pasted new pictures of idols. These were the
"door gods" who were expected to frighten
the evil spirits away.</p>

<p>It was a busy morning for Jennie Crawford.
As in most hospitals, there seemed to be more
work than there were people to do it. She assisted
with two operations, she made a visit to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
every bed, sometimes saying only a word of
encouragement, but oftener lending a hand in
a delicate dressing or superintending the bathing
of a very ill patient. She was an expert
nurse, and the poor women and children looked
at her affectionately, knowing that when her
tender hands were compelled to hurt them, it
was because she loved them.</p>

<p>As Miss Crawford looked down the street,
she could tell the houses of Christians because
on them were no hideous pictures, but, instead,
beautiful verses from the Bible giving God's
promise to care for those who trust in Him.</p>

<p>Everyone goes calling on New Year's Day in
China, and many callers came to bring good
wishes to Miss Crawford. Little Mrs. Tsao, the
wife of the Chinese Christian pastor, came
early. Her hair was brushed until it shone like
folds of black satin.</p>

<p>"Oh, that the light of God may this year shine
upon China just as the sun shines today!" she
said.</p>

<p>Next came Miss Crawford's Chinese teacher,
who was so dressed up for the New Year that
she scarcely knew him. He did not lift his hat
as he came in, for that would have been most
impolite. From the long, full sleeve of his coat,
he took a package wrapped in a yellow silk
handkerchief. He unwrapped the package and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
handed one of his large, red paper calling cards
to Miss Crawford.</p>

<p>A procession of fifteen men from the Christian
Church came together. Their hair was
plaited in long queues which hung down their
backs. The queues were tied with long black
silk tassels which almost touched the floor. All
wore their longest and handsomest gowns. The
bright red buttons on top of their black satin
caps meant that they brought congratulations,
for red is the color of happiness in China. Each
man bowed very low and shook his own hand
instead of Miss Crawford's to wish her a happy
New Year.</p>

<p>All day long the callers came and drank tea
and ate Chinese sweets. In the evening Miss
Crawford and her friend Jennie Cody, a teacher
in the Bible School, sat down together.</p>

<p>"The people in Hanyang are learning to trust
us and to really love us," said Jennie Crawford,
happily. "Better still, they are learning to
trust and love God. Did you notice how many
of the doors had Bible verses over them today
instead of those hideous gods? I'm glad every
day that I came to China."</p>

<p>"Would you still be glad if we had such fighting
and riots here as they had across the river
in Hankow last week?" asked Jennie Cody.</p>

<p>Jennie Crawford laughed. "I've never had a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
chance to find out what I would do in a battle,"
she said. "I'll tell you about that later."</p>

<p>"Things look as if you might have a chance
to find out very soon," said Jennie Cody.</p>

<p>Presently a native Bible teacher came in and
sat down with them.</p>

<p>"We were talking about the rumors of war,"
said Miss Crawford. "Do you think there will
really be a revolution?"</p>

<p>"There must be a revolution," she answered.
"You Americans would never have had freedom
to govern your own country if you had not had
your revolution. It is even worse in China.
Three hundred years ago the Manchus came
from the north and took the government away
from the Chinese, put a Manchu emperor on the
throne, and made the yellow flag with its dragon
the flag of China. They compelled the men of
China to plait their hair in queues, and whenever
a Chinese man dared to cut off his queue,
the soldiers of the emperor cut off his head.
The Chinese want to be free to rule their own
land as you do in America."</p>

<p>"I wish that China was a republic like the
United States, but I'm afraid I'd make a poor
soldier in a revolution," said Jennie Cody.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In October came rumors of riots and warfare.
One evening as Jennie Crawford sat writing in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
her room in the school building, she heard a
loud knocking at the door and a voice calling.
There stood Jennie Cody holding up a letter.
She had sped across the drill ground of the
school and along the dark city wall to the hospital.</p>

<p>"A letter has come from the father of a pupil,"
she gasped. "He is a Chinese official and
he says that there are rumors that a rebellion
will start tomorrow."</p>

<p>"We have heard many rumors of war," said
Jennie Crawford. "This is only another."</p>

<p>The next day passed and the next and the
next and still all was quiet. That night she
slept without fear.</p>

<p>Early the following morning a Bible woman
came to her. "I've been up all night," she
said. "The people are fleeing to the country by
hundreds, carrying on their backs bundles of
bedding and clothing. All night there has been
a procession leaving the city. They say that the
revolution is beginning and that the hardest
fighting will be in Hanyang because the guns
and powder are stored here in the great arsenal,
and both armies will try to capture that."</p>

<p>Before noon another letter came. Jennie
Crawford read it quickly.</p>

<p>"The American consul says, 'All American
women and children must leave Hanyang for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
a place of safety at once. Fighting has begun
near by!'"</p>

<p>Dr. Huntley, the physician in charge of the
hospital, called a meeting of all missionaries.</p>

<p>"We don't want to go," said Jennie Crawford.
"The school is full of girls, and the hospital
is full of patients. We don't want to leave
them."</p>

<p>It was agreed that the women and children
in the hospital and the girls in the school would
be safer at their homes. Jennie Crawford and
the teachers found escorts for pupils and patients,
while Dr. Huntley went across the river
to Hankow to consult the British consul.</p>

<p>"The missionaries in Wuchang thought
they would not have to leave," said the consul.
"Now the gates of the city have been closed.
The American consul has been trying to get
them out, but he cannot reach them. Fighting
is going on all round the mission. You must
get the American women and children out of
Hanyang before the soldiers enter."</p>

<p>Dr. Huntley hurried home. The frightened
boatman did not want to wait a minute. As he
stepped out of the boat, Dr. Huntley took out
his watch.</p>

<p>"It is twenty minutes after four," he said.
"Promise me that you will wait here with your
boat until five."</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>The boatman promised, and the doctor hurried
to the hospital. At the tea-table in the
dining-room sat Mrs. Huntley with Jennie
Crawford and Jennie Cody.</p>

<p>"We have no choice, we must leave in thirty
minutes," announced Dr. Huntley. "Get together
a few things and take no more than you
can carry."</p>

<p>The half-emptied teacups left on the table as
the women hurried from the dining-room were
to remain there many days. Gathering up a few
things, they started for the boat as the sun was
setting. On a hill back of the hospital were six
hundred soldiers of the Manchu Emperor.</p>

<p>"They are likely to fire!" said one of the
servants.</p>

<p>But no gun was fired as the party went out.
The boatman was waiting, although he trembled
with fear. The river was rough, and the waves
threatened to swallow the little boat, but it
reached Hankow in safety.</p>

<p>The city was crowded, and the only rooms to
be found were in a poor little hotel. None of
the party slept that night.</p>

<p>"If you hear a signal in the night," they
were warned, "it will mean, 'Danger! Rise and
dress!' If there is a second signal, it will mean,
'All gather near the gunboats!' A third signal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
will mean, 'Great danger! American women
and children get into the boats!'"</p>

<p>All night they listened, but they heard only
the steady tramp, tramp of the guards who
marched up and down the streets.</p>

<p>In the morning a messenger called out, "The
soldiers entered Hanyang in the night!"</p>

<p>If the boatman had not waited, they would
have been shut up in the city.</p>

<p>"Rich Chinese men and women are paying
much money to be let down over the walls in
baskets, for the gates are closed, and no one
can get out any other way," said the messenger.</p>

<p>In the evening Jennie Crawford saw thirty
girls coming down the street.</p>

<p>"Here come the schoolgirls from Wuchang!"
she cried joyfully.</p>

<p>Each girl carried the few clothes she had been
able to save tied up in a square of cotton cloth.</p>

<p>"For two days and nights we were shut in
the school building," said one. "The bullets
flew all round, and we could see burning buildings
every way we looked. Then the rescue
party reached us. We had our bundles all
ready to leave at a moment's notice."</p>

<p>They were very tired, yet they stood bravely
round the walls of the room, for there were no
chairs. Not one knew whether she had a home<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
or any friends left, but not even the youngest
cried or complained.</p>

<p>"Extra! Extra!" shouted a newspaper messenger
as he carried his papers from house to
house. "Twenty thousand troops on the way
from Peking!"</p>

<p>Jennie Crawford bought a paper and everyone
gathered round her.</p>

<p>"Twenty thousand of the Emperor's soldiers
are on their way from Peking!" she announced.
"The British and American consuls advise all
foreign women and children to go on to
Shanghai!"</p>

<p>On to Shanghai they went that evening. The
city was crowded with many refugees. At last
they were safe with friends who were waiting
for them there, and who gave them a glad
welcome.</p>

<p>But they did not stay in Shanghai. After a
few days Dr. Huntley came into the sitting-room
one morning with a paper in his hand.</p>

<p>"The call has come for Red Cross doctors
and nurses to go to Hankow," he said. "The
wounded soldiers of both armies are being taken
there, and there is no one to care for them. I'm
going to volunteer to return as a Red Cross
surgeon."</p>

<p>"I'll go with you as a Red Cross nurse," said
Jennie Crawford.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Jennie Crawford Administering an Anesthetic</span></p>

<p class="caption">Assisting with operations, lending a hand in delicate dressings, and giving a word of encouragement
and comfort wherever needed, Miss Crawford became a beloved nurse.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>"Take me, too!" begged Jennie Cody.</p>

<p>"No Americans except doctors and nurses
are allowed to enter the city," answered Dr.
Huntley.</p>

<p>Jennie Cody looked up at him. "The one
thing I have said I never, never could be is a
nurse, but I won't be a coward when Jennie
Crawford needs help, and wounded soldiers
have no one to nurse them. Pin the red cross
on my arm and maybe that will give me courage."</p>

<p>When they bought tickets, the agent said,
"You go at your own risk. I can make no promise
that you will ever reach Hankow. Many
boats are being fired on."</p>

<p>But as the boat with the red cross on its white
flag went up the river, the soldiers of both
armies lowered their guns.</p>

<p>Such a different Hankow they found! The
crowded streets were deserted; even the beggars
were gone. The smoke still hung over the
ruins of many buildings which had been burned.
The fire had not touched an unfinished hospital,
and in it they found many wounded soldiers.
Most of the fighting was in Hanyang, and the
Red Cross launches brought the wounded men
of both armies across the river.</p>

<p>Two nurses were already there for day duty,
so Jennie Crawford and Jennie Cody slept in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
the day and went on duty at night going up and
down between the rows of soldiers like angels
of mercy. There were few beds, and most of
the men had to lie on straw on the floor with no
sheets or pillows.</p>

<p>"Which way will it go?" said Jennie Cody
one day.</p>

<p>"No one can tell," answered Jennie Crawford.
"Just now the revolutionists are ahead.
They have captured the arsenal in Hanyang.
Three hundred of their soldiers went up to the
gate with their clothes torn and looking as if
they had been in a battle. They pretended to
be the soldiers of the Emperor who had been
defeated. The gate-keepers let them in, and
they took charge of the arsenal without firing a
single shot. Now the people are so sure the
revolutionists will win that many men have already
cut off their queues. The soldiers with
swords in their hands demand that men prove
they are loyal to the new republic by having
their queues cut off."</p>

<p>"If we could only get back to Hanyang again
to get some warm clothes!" sighed Jennie Cody.
"I'm almost frozen without my winter coat."</p>

<p>"Let's try to go over with Dr. Huntley in the
Red Cross launch," proposed Jennie Crawford.
"None of the soldiers of either army will fire
at that."</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>When they reached Hanyang, they saw empty
rickshaws along the river bank and many other
signs of a hasty retreat. Before they reached
their home, a man ran toward them.</p>

<p>"You must be ready to leave at a moment's
notice," he cried. "The soldiers of the Emperor
have taken the city again."</p>

<p>In the dining-room the teacups still stood on
the table, but they did not stop to put them
away. Hastily gathering a few garments, they
hurried back to the boat.</p>

<p>Before the boat could pull out, the bullets
were falling close beside them. Within half an
hour a terrible battle was fought between the
troops of the Emperor on the Hankow side of
the river and those of the revolutionists on the
other side. Nearer and nearer to the hospital
came the bullets. One day the two nurses were
awakened by the sound of shells directly over
their heads. A bullet struck the wall of the
room. Jennie Cody picked it up and with a
smile that showed she was not afraid, put it
away for a souvenir. The little Red Cross
launches brought in more and yet more wounded
soldiers until the nurses could scarcely step
between the beds of straw. Again and again
bullets fell near by, but none struck the Americans.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>"That is because the bullets were made by
foreigners," explained the Chinese. "They
have eyes so they can see, and never hit the
people who made them."</p>

<p>After the troops of the Emperor had captured
Hanyang, they took Hankow and Wuchang.
It seemed that the revolution had failed and
that the yellow flag with its Manchu dragon
would still float above China.</p>

<p>"Look at that man!" said Jennie Crawford
one day. "He cut off his queue when he thought
the revolutionists had won. Then when the soldiers
of the Emperor recaptured the city, he
was afraid they would cut off his head if they
saw him without a queue, and he pinned one to
his cap."</p>

<p>"Many men have done that," answered Jennie
Cody. "When they think the soldiers of
the Emperor are going to win, they let their
queues hang down their backs; then if they
think victory is going to the revolutionists,
they tuck them up under their caps."</p>

<p>"The days may seem dark for the new republic,
but even though the arsenal has been captured
by the soldiers of the Emperor, good news
comes from Shanghai and Nanking," said Jennie
Crawford. "Everywhere the people are demanding
that China shall be free. Shanghai<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
has been taken by the revolutionists without any
fighting and Nanking has already been made the
capital of the new government."</p>

<p>Jennie Crawford's prophecy came true.
When in 1912 New Year's Day came to China,&mdash;this
time on January first by law,&mdash;Mr. Sun
Yat-Sen was inaugurated as the first president
of the great Chinghwa (Chinese) Republic, and
the dragon flag came down. Instead, there
floated a rainbow flag with stripes of five colors
to represent the five peoples of China. There
was a red stripe for the Chinese, a blue stripe
for the Mongols, a white stripe for the Mohammedans,
and a black stripe for the Tibetans.
Instead of killing all the Manchu soldiers and
the boy emperor, the new republic put a fifth
stripe of yellow in its flag for the Manchu people
who were to be a part of the new republic.</p>

<p>When the news reached the two nurses, Miss
Crawford said to Miss Cody, "Now I can get
back to my own hospital in Hanyang, to all the
women and children who are waiting for me."
But for many weeks they stayed to nurse the
men who could not be moved.</p>

<p>One day they received a command from General
Li Yuan Hung, vice-president of the new
republic, to come to Wuchang, which was
thronged with people from many nations, England,
France, America, Germany, Russia, Italy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
Japan, and Sweden. There the Vice-President
presented to them bronze medals "in recognition
of their bravery and self-sacrifice, in caring
for the wounded during the revolution."</p>

<p>"I have almost forgotten the noise of battle
and those days in the hospital," said Jennie
Crawford as they went back to Hanyang. "But
I can never forget that Chinese soldier who
looked up at us one night as we tried to ease his
pain, and said, 'You are like God to us.'</p>

<p>"'Oh, no,' I answered at once.</p>

<p>"'Well,' said he, as I smoothed his pillow
of straw, 'you are the ones who make us know
about God.'</p>

<p>"Now I can answer you that I'm still glad I
came to China."</p>

<small>SIXTY-SIX DAYS WITH BANDITS</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">On</span> a cold November morning a group of girls
stood beside two mules in front of a house in
Batang on the border of Tibet. Two were
Americans, and the others, Tibetans.</p>

<p>"How long must you stay in America,
Doris?" asked one of the Tibetan girls very
sadly.</p>

<p>"If I study hard every day," answered
Doris, "I can come back in ten years."</p>

<p>"That's not so bad," said another of the
girls, "because, you see, if you will study night
and day, you can get through and come back in
five years."</p>

<p>"We must go," said Dorothy. "Father and
Mother have gone on a half-hour ago."</p>

<p>There were tears in all eyes as Doris and
Dorothy sprang into their saddles.</p>

<p>"Good-by! Good-by!" they called as the
mules started forward.</p>

<p>Since they were babies, Doris and Dorothy
Shelton had lived in Tibet, the land that is called
"the roof of the world," because it is higher
than any other country in the world. They had
taken many trips, clinging to the backs of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
mules as they went almost straight up on the
rough mountain roads, but the journey on which
they were starting now, as the sun rose from
behind the snow-capped mountains, was to be
the most thrilling of all.</p>



<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/p117.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">The Shelton Family Crossing the Mountains of Tibet</span></p>

<p class="caption">Mrs. Shelton and the girls are in the chairs carried by barefoot coolies.</p>

<p>They soon overtook their mother and father
and the servants. In front of the party rode
guards, for the country was full of robber
bands. Then came six mule drivers driving the
twenty-five mules<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span> that were loaded with tents,
baggage, and food. Following the mule drivers
Mrs. Shelton rode in a sedan chair fastened to
two poles which rested on the shoulders of four
carriers who wore fine, bright-red turbans and
long robes of grey <i>pulu</i> or wool, which were tied
about the waist. In the party were Andru,
Drashi, and Shen-si, the three servants who had
helped to care for Doris and Dorothy since they
were babies.</p>

<p>Last of all, on a mule strong enough to carry
his two hundred and thirty pounds, rode Dr.
Albert Shelton. Everyone in Batang knew
"Big Doctor Shelton," and everyone loved
him.</p>

<p>Seventeen years before this time, when he
left the medical school in Kansas, he looked over
a map of the world to find the place that needed
a doctor most. There was not a town in Kansas
that did not have a doctor in it or near to it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
and in some of the towns there were many
doctors.</p>

<p>"I should like to go to a place where there
are no other doctors," he said.</p>

<p>"Well, then," said a friend, "go to Tibet.
That is the place for you, because in all Tibet
there is no doctor. But you may not get there
alive. The Dalai Lama, who is the head of
everything in Tibet, government and Buddhist
Church, lives in Lhasa, the capital, and he will
not let any Christian missionary or doctor come
within the walls of his city. Some have tried
to go, but most of them were killed."</p>

<p>The more Albert Shelton thought about the
land without a doctor, the more he wished to go
there. He talked to his young wife, and she
wanted to go, too, so one day they took a
steamer from San Francisco and crossed the
Pacific Ocean to China where a boat carried
them a thousand miles up the Yangtze River.
Then they went still farther on a little Chinese
house-boat pulled by thirty men who walked
along the bank. After the house-boat had gone
up the river for nearly two months, they stepped
off on shore and rode on the backs of mules for
seven hundred miles.</p>

<p>More than a year after they left Kansas, they
reached the town of Tatsienlu on the border of
Tibet. If they could have stuck a pin eight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
thousand miles long right through the earth,
it would have come out not far from where they
started. The nearest doctor was seven hundred
miles away, so Dr. Shelton decided to live in
Tatsienlu until he could find a way to get farther
into the closed land of Tibet.</p>

<p>Doris and Dorothy were born at Tatsienlu,
among mountains that rose more than twenty
thousand feet above the level of the ocean, so
high that they were covered with snow in July
and August. They were used to the strange
little "yaks,"&mdash;houses covered with goat's
hair. They watched their father make brick
and saw lumber and teach the men how to build
houses like the one he had built for himself.</p>

<p>After five years Dr. Shelton was permitted
to go farther inland to Batang to start a hospital.
When the people heard of the "good
doctor" who had come so far across the ocean,
and who could do such wonderful things to make
sick people well, they came from all over the
country to see him. At first he had to use for
his operating table a door laid across two tables.
Then he and his friends sawed lumber and
baked brick and built a hospital. For ten years
he lived at Batang, and many thousands of people
came there to be helped.</p>

<p class="caption">He ministered to all who needed him despite the lack of a hospital. This treatment is being

<p>Then a wonderful thing happened&mdash;Dr. Shelton
was to go into Lhasa, the capital of the land-without-a-doctor.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
The Dalai Lama had kept out
all missionaries because he was afraid the people
would discover that their idols were not
true gods and would not give the priests any
more money. But now the Dalai Lama himself
gave Dr. Shelton permission to come.</p>

<p>Before going to Lhasa Dr. Shelton planned
to take Mrs. Shelton and Doris and Dorothy to
the port of Hongkong, from which they were to
sail to America, where the girls were to go to
school. It was on this journey that they were
starting on this November morning.</p>

<p>Mrs. Shelton did not want to say good-by to
the people of Batang, whom she loved, so she
tried to slip away before daybreak. But as she
and the doctor rode along, they found people
lined up on either side of the road to bid them
good-by. Many had left their homes the night
before and had marched ahead so they could
stand by the road and see their "big doctor"
and his wife and children once more. An escort
of twenty-five boys had been sent ahead. All
the way from Batang to the Yangtze River, a
journey of a day and a half, the people were
gathered along the roadside.</p>

<p>For thirty-six days Doris and Dorothy rode
on their mules. Then they were so tired, their
father got chairs for them and they were carried
by the servants.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>One day as they were riding along, Dorothy
said:</p>

<p>"Are you afraid of robbers, Doris? I heard
Andru and Shen-si say that Yang Tien-fu, the
leader of a dreadful band must be near by. He
is very angry at the government. He used to
be a colonel in the Chinese army, but they
didn't pay his salary, so he got a band of men
to join him, and they live out in the mountains.
Andru said they stop all travelers and take pay
from them."</p>

<p>"I'm not afraid," said Doris. "We have soldiers
to guard us."</p>

<p>"I'm glad we are almost at Yunnanfu. Forty-seven
days is a long time to ride. Father says
we will be at Yunnanfu in just two and a half
days."</p>

<p>Suddenly, as the mules came out from behind
a bend in the road, they threw back their ears
and stopped. The report of a pistol rang out.</p>

<p>"Robbers! Robbers!" shouted the soldiers.</p>

<p>Another pistol shot followed, and the robbers
sprang down through the brush of the mountainside.
There was a crashing of glass, as a bullet
struck the thermos bottle by Mrs. Shelton's
side.</p>

<p>"Robbers! Robbers!" shouted the four soldiers
again. One shot off his gun; then all four
ran back to the village.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>Mrs. Shelton and the girls crept out of their
chairs and slipped over the bank into the ditch
below.</p>

<p>Bullets flew. The bandits surrounded Dr.
Shelton; one drew a large pistol and another
a great sword. Dr. Shelton saw there was no
chance to escape, so he let them take from him
his field-glasses, his camera, and everything
else they wanted. Andru was seized and his
knife and chop-sticks taken from his belt. Holding
up Dr. Shelton by both arms, two of the
bandits led him up the mountain to their chief.
The others tried to get Mrs. Shelton to climb
the bluff which rose straight before them, but
she was not able. Then they tried to carry her,
but they could not get up the steep, narrow
path with a load.</p>

<p>Doris wore gloves, but little Dorothy's hands
were bare. The robbers saw her rings and took
them off her fingers. Dorothy loved those rings
which had been given to her by her friends, and
she began to cry. Doris had been very much
frightened by the robbers, but when she saw
one of them with Dorothy's rings, she forgot
about herself and going up to the robber said:</p>

<p>"You give those rings back to Dorothy!"</p>

<p>The robber smiled at the girl who was so
brave for her little sister and actually handed
the rings back.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>By this time the soldiers returned with other
soldiers and rushed out to attack the robbers,
who left Mrs. Shelton and Doris and Dorothy
and began fighting to defend themselves. At
once the two girls with their mother and the
servants slipped back to the village.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Dr. Shelton was being hurried
along up the mountainside to the robber chief.
Taller and stronger than any of the men who
stood about him was Yang Tien-fu. He looked
with interest at the things his men had taken
from the travelers and examined Dr. Shelton's
camera and field-glasses.</p>

<p>"How can this picture-box make pictures?"
he asked. "Now stop and make my picture."</p>

<p>Dr. Shelton snapped the kodak.</p>

<p>"Now take my picture out of the box and let
me see it."</p>

<p>"There is no picture there yet," said Dr.
Shelton.</p>

<p>Yang Tien-fu would not believe him and made
him open the camera and spoil the first picture
of a robber chief he had ever had a chance to
take.</p>

<p>Dr. Shelton could look down to the valley and
watch the battle between the bandits and the
soldiers. He saw Mrs. Shelton's empty chair.</p>

<p>"Why do you want to take me as a prisoner?"
he asked.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>"Because I must have money," answered the
bandit.</p>

<p>"I have no money," said Dr. Shelton.</p>

<p>"But your people will offer me a ransom. I
have plenty of soldiers in my land, but they
have little to fight with. I will tell your people
that if they will send me fifty thousand dollars'
worth of guns and powder and bullets I will
release you. And that is not all. The government
has taken my family and is keeping them
as prisoners. I will tell them that if they will
send my family back to me, I will send you back
to them. Get on your mule, for we must travel
far from here."</p>

<p>Over the rough, steep road of the mountain
they rode for many hours. Not until the sun
went down did they stop to rest and to wait for
their companions. They built a fire and cooked
rice. After they had eaten, they took out their
long pipes and smoked opium. Dr. Shelton
counted seventy-one men.</p>

<p>When those who had stayed to fight the soldiers
overtook the band, Dr. Shelton saw that
one man was shot through the ankle. He opened
his saddle-bags and dressed the wound while
Yang Tien-fu watched with interest. After
resting a few hours they started to travel again.</p>

<p>For three days and nights Dr. Shelton did not
take off his clothes or sleep. Sometimes he lay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
down on an old horse blanket, the only bed he
had. Four robbers guarded him. They never
took off the belts in which they carried their
guns and cartridges. Dr. Shelton counted nineteen
different kinds of guns and eight kinds of
pistols, all of which had been taken from travelers.</p>

<p>Day after day the bandits traveled over the
mountains. When they stopped, forty guards
were sent in every direction, for Yang Tien-fu
knew that the government had offered a reward
of five thousand dollars to anyone who would
capture him dead or alive.</p>

<p>Sometimes he divided his men, sending a
party to march straight down over the steep
mountainside to make a false trail, and often
he stood on some high bluff and laughed as he
watched the soldiers being led astray. Almost
every day, and sometimes many times a day, the
bandits would stop a company of travelers and
take their money or go into a little village and
rob the frightened people.</p>

<p>If the villagers gave them what they asked
for, there was no fighting. Yang Tien-fu would
go into the temple, which was the meeting place
of the people, and send his men out to find one
of the head men of the village. When he came
in, the chief would say:</p>

<p>"We are not robbers. We are traveling to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
escort this great foreign official. He must
have two hogs and ten bushels of rice."</p>

<p>Then the head men would look at Dr. Shelton
with great respect and interest and start
off to get all the things the great foreign official
must have. Meanwhile Dr. Shelton tried
to get them to understand that he was a prisoner.
Often he had to smile at the cunning of
the robber chief.</p>

<p>As they went along, Dr. Shelton saw many
people who were sick and many whose eyes
were sore or blind. He said to Yang Tien-fu,
"I left America to help the sick people in
Tibet. Since you are keeping me away from
my hospital in Batang, you must let me have
a hospital along the road."</p>

<p>So the chief waited while the doctor healed
the sick. Many soldiers joined the band, and
the doctor ministered to all who needed him.</p>

<p>One day the chief said, "You are an honest
man. I want you to be one of my men and stay
with us. These other fellows can't be trusted.
Even our treasurer steals. Stay with us and
be the pastor and the doctor for me and my
men. I will pay you twelve thousand dollars
a year and give you half of it right now."</p>

<p>Dr. Shelton chuckled. He wondered whether
anyone else had ever been invited to be the
pastor of a robber band.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>Back in Yunnanfu Mrs. Shelton, Doris, and
Dorothy waited. Every day the girls went to
the gate of the city, hoping to see a runner
coming with a message from their father.</p>

<p>"But, Doris," said Dorothy, "there is no
chance for Father to escape. He is guarded
all the time."</p>

<p>"The Bible says that Paul and Silas were
sleeping right between guards, and God opened
the doors of the prison," said Doris. "If we
pray, God may open some door so Father can
escape."</p>

<p>Thus while the robber band was climbing
the steep mountain and leading their tired
prisoner farther and farther away, two little
girls knelt down to pray.</p>

<p>For nearly three weeks no message came.</p>

<p>"If we could only know if Father is still
living and if he is well!" said Mrs. Shelton.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Doris. "Or if we could get a
message to him so he could know we are praying
for him!"</p>

<p>One day Shen-si, the Chinese cook who had
lived with them many years, said:</p>

<p>"I will carry your message to my master
and bring his message to you."</p>

<p>"How can you find him, Shen-si?" asked
Dorothy. "How will you get past the chief of
the bandits?"</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>"I will face Yang Tien-fu and carry your
message to my master and bring his message
to you," said Shen-si quietly.</p>

<p>Mrs. Shelton and the girls wrote letters and
Shen-si started out to find his master. All
along the way he followed the robbers, asking
questions until he reached the place where he
was told his master was. He went boldly up to
the guards.</p>

<p>"I come on important business," he announced.
"I must speak to your chief."</p>

<p>The guards led him to Yang Tien-fu. Behind
the chief he saw his master, so changed
that he scarcely knew him. A long beard had
grown over his smooth face, and he was so
weak he could scarcely walk. Tears came into
Shen-si's eyes.</p>

<p>Dr. Shelton was allowed to send a message
back, and he handed Shen-si a copy of <i>Beside
the Bonnie Brier Bush</i> to take to Mrs. Shelton.
This he had had in his saddle-bags when
the robbers captured him. On the margins he
had written daily messages to his wife. One
of the last was:</p>

<p>"I am tired to death; all I can say in my
desolation is, 'Make Thy grace sufficient for
me, O God.'"</p>

<p>With the precious book Shen-si started back.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/p131.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">A Roadside Luncheon in Tibet</span></p>

<p class="caption">Dr. Shelton and his daughters at luncheon with a group of Tibetan friends.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>Shen-si was not the only one who had determined
to reach Dr. Shelton. One day Yang
Tien-fu said to his prisoner:</p>

<p>"The government has sent a messenger to
me to say that my family is at the priest's
house and that if I will send you there in exchange,
my family will be given to me. I am
almost afraid to trust them, for they do not
keep their word as you do, but I am going to
send you to the priest's house with a strong
guard."</p>

<p>Twenty of the robbers took Dr. Shelton to
the priest's house. There Yang Tien-fu found
only his wife and mother.</p>

<p>"What do two women amount to?" he said
angrily. "I can buy another wife as good as
that one for a hundred dollars any time. Have
them bring me my son."</p>

<p>A contract was prepared promising Yang
Tien-fu that if he would release Dr. Shelton,
the Chinese government would give him pardon
for himself and his men, make him an
officer in the army, return all his family to him
and give him the arms and ammunition for
which he had asked. On the next day the contract
was to be signed by him and by the
Chinese governor.</p>

<p>Late at night some of the men, who had been
out watching, hurried to the chief.</p>

<p>"The government has you in a trap," they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
said, "many troops of soldiers are stealing in
quietly to surround you and capture you."</p>

<p>Quickly Yang Tien-fu took both his family
and Dr. Shelton, and at midnight they slipped
out between the circles of soldiers, back to the
mountains. Again began the long, hard journeys.
Soon Yang Tien-fu saw that his prisoner
was too weak to walk or even to sit on his
mule, so he had a rough chair made for him.
For thirty-seven hours they carried him, running
as fast as they could, for the soldiers were
following. One day the chief said:</p>

<p>"The doctor is so sick and weak he can go
no farther. Take him to the loft of that barn
and hide him in the straw. Place four guards
with him. If he dies, hide his body where no
one will find it; if he gets well, send a messenger
to me, and I will come for him."</p>

<p>The men made a tunnel through the rice-straw
to the back of the loft, digging out a
space large enough for a bed for the doctor at
the end. They took a brick out of the wall to
make a small hole for a window. As they
dragged their sick prisoner into his straw
house, one of them said:</p>

<p>"The 'big doctor' is the same as a dead
man."</p>

<p>The newspapers all over the world had
printed the story of Dr. Shelton's capture by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
the robbers, and day by day people in many
lands waited to hear that the governor and his
soldiers had caught Yang Tien-fu and released
Dr. Shelton. One day the American Minister
at Peking started a rescue party of several
English and Americans with troops. They sent
a message to Yang Tien-fu demanding the release
of Dr. Shelton; then they started into the
mountains to find him. When they left, Doris
and Dorothy went with them to the gate of the
city.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the "big doctor," almost too
weak to move, was lying on his bed of straw,
with his head by the little window.</p>

<p>"Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday,"&mdash;he
counted the days as they went by.</p>

<p>An old Chinese man brought him rice, and the
rest and food made him feel so much better
that the men who were guarding him slipped
off to tell the chief he was not dead, leaving
the Chinese to guard him. Late one afternoon
the old man cried out in terror, "The soldiers
are coming!" and ran as fast as he could.</p>

<p>Dr. Shelton crawled to the street and called
to the Chinese runner who had so frightened
his guard. The villagers had heard the cries,
"The soldiers are coming!" and had run to
the hills. When the messenger found out that
the man who stood before him was the "big<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
doctor," he was almost as frightened as the
villagers.</p>

<p>As soon as he could get his breath, he helped
the doctor to escape. Leaning on his deliverer's
arm, Dr. Shelton crept along for a quarter
of a mile to the next village. There was no
horse on which he could ride and no chair on
which he could be carried, but eight men of
the village were persuaded to help. They
twisted ropes of wild grass and tied them about
the doctor's waist. Some men lifted, some
pushed, and some pulled on the ropes until
they reached the next village, which was fortunately
a Christian village. The people met
them with joy. They were afraid to stop long
for fear the robbers would overtake them, so
they slept for only an hour and then started on.</p>

<p>They found two small ponies, and at half-past
four in the morning they offered a prayer
that God would take care of the "big doctor,"
and lifted him to a pony's back. He was so
weak that two men had to hold him on. When
one pony was tired, they lifted him to the other.</p>

<p>Presently Dr. Shelton looked up and saw
two hundred soldiers approaching, and soon
recognized his friends. He heard English
spoken for the first time in sixty-six days, and
he could not speak for joy. One of the rescue
party had a box of crackers. He ate them at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
once, because since he was captured, he had
had nothing but rice. His friends had to lend
him clothes, for his were worn out.</p>

<p>At the gate of Yunnanfu five hundred people
came to welcome Dr. Shelton home. First and
foremost were two little girls who ran to put
their arms round his neck and whisper, "We
prayed for you! We prayed for you! The
Lord does answer prayers, doesn't he?"</p>

<p>Dr. Shelton patted the two heads.</p>

<p>"Of course he does," he said. "That is why
I am here."</p>

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
